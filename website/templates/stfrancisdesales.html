        <p>
          St. Francis de Sales (21 August 1567-28 December 1622) was the Bishop of
          Geneva and is honoured as a
          <br />saint in the Catholic Church. He became noted for his deep faith
          and gentle approach to the religious <br />divisions in his land
          resulting from the Protestant Reformation. He is known also for his
          writings on <br />the topic of spiritual direction and spiritual
          formation, particularly the Introduction to the Devout <br />Life and
          the Treatise on the Love of God. Francis de Sales was born on 21 August
          1567 in the Chateau <br />de Sales into the noble Sales family of the
          Duchy of Savoy in what is today Thorens-Glieres, Haute-Savoie,
          <br />France. His father was Francois de Sales, Lord of Boisy, Sales,
          and Novel. His mother was Francoise de <br />Sionnaz, the only child of
          the prominent magistrate Melchior de Sionnaz and a noblewoman. He was
          baptized <br />Francis Bonaventura after two great Franciscan saints.
          His father wanted him, the first of his six sons, <br />to attend the
          best schools in preparation for a career as a magistrate. He, therefore,
          enjoyed a privileged <br />education in the nearby town of La
          Roche-Sur-Foron, and at the age eight at the Capuchin college in Annecy.
        </p>
        <h2>Education and conversion</h2>
        <p>
          In 1578, de Sales went to the College de Clermont, then a Jesuit
          institution, to study rhetoric and
          <br />humanities. On this first visit to Paris, he lived near the Eglise
          Sainte-Genevieve with his three <br />cousins. As a nobleman, he was
          accompanied by his servant and by a priest tutor, Abbe Deage. To please
          <br />his father, he took lessons in the gentlemanly pursuits of riding,
          dancing, and fencing. De Sales is <br />described as intelligent and
          handsome, tall and well built with blue-grey eyes, somewhat reserved and
          <br />quiet, and a welcome guest in the homes of the nobility among whom
          his father had connections. <br />In 1586 Francis de Sales attended a
          theological discussion about predestination, convincing him of his
          <br />damnation to hell. A personal crisis of despair resulted. This
          conviction lasted through December 1586. <br />His great despair made
          him physically ill and even bedridden for a time. Sometime in either
          late December <br />or early January 1587, he visited the old parish of
          Saint-Etienne-des-Gres, Paris, where he prayed the <br />"Memorare"
          before a famed statue of Our Lady of Good Deliverance, a Black Madonna.
          He consecrated himself <br />to the Blessed Virgin Mary and decided to
          dedicate his life to God with a vow of chastity He then became <br />a
          tertiary of the Minim Order.
        </p>
        <h2>Priest and provost</h2>
        <p>
          Because the Calvinists controlled Geneva, the bishop resided about
          twenty miles south, in Annecy. De
          <br />Sales preached in the Cathedral of Annecy, at parish churches, and
          before confraternities. He was an <br />effective speaker, his voice was
          deep and rich in tone, his speech somewhat slow and measured. His
          <br />sermons were comparatively short and without the customary
          displays of erudition. He avoided controversy <br />and focused on a
          particular point of duty, a specific virtue, or the correction of some
          vice The cathedral <br />chapter recommended that, although only
          twenty-seven years of age, the provost be named Grand Penitentiary
          <br />of the diocese, with the result that de Sales found himself taking
          many more confessions.
        </p>
        <h2>Bishop of Geneva</h2>
        <p>
          In 1602, Bishop Granier died, and Sales was consecrated Bishop of Geneva
          by Vespasien Gribaldi, assisted
          <br />by Thomas Pobel and Jacques Maistret, O.Carm. as co-consecrators.
          He resided in Annecy (now part of <br />modern-day France) because
          Geneva remained under Calvinist control and therefore closed to him. His
          diocese <br />became famous throughout Europe for its efficient
          organization, zealous clergy and well-instructed laity, <br />an
          achievement in those days. He worked closely with the Order of Friars
          Minor Capuchin, which was very <br />active in preaching the Catholic
          faith in his diocese. They appreciated his cooperation so much that in
          1617 <br />they made him an official associate of the Order, the highest
          honor possible for a non-member. It is said that <br />at Evian, on the
          south shore of Lake Geneva, St. Francis of Assisi appeared to him and
          said: "You desire martyrdom, <br />just as I once longed for it. But,
          like me, you will not obtain it. You will have to become an instrument
          of your <br />own martyrdom." During his years as bishop, de Sales
          acquired a reputation as a spellbinding preacher and something <br />of
          an ascetic. His motto was, "He who preaches with love, preaches
          effectively." His goodness, patience and mildness <br />became
          proverbial.
        </p>
        <h2>Veneration and Death</h2>
        <p>
          In December 1622 de Sales was required to travel in the entourage of
          Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy,
          <br />for the Duke's Christmas tour of his domain. Upon arrival in Lyon,
          de Sales chose to stay in the gardener's <br />hut at the Visitandine
          monastery in that city. While there he suffered a stroke, from which he
          died on <br />28 December 1622. St. Francis de Sales has been styled
          "the Gentleman Saint" because of his patience and <br />gentleness.
          Despite the resistance of the populace of Lyon to moving his remains
          from that city, Sales was <br />buried on 24 January 1623 in the church
          of the Monastery of the Visitation in Annecy, which he had founded
          <br />with Chantal, who was also buried there. Their remains were
          venerated there until the French Revolution. <br />Many miracles have
          been reported at his shrine. De Sales' heart was kept in Lyon, in
          response to the popular <br />demand of the citizens of the city to
          retain his remains. During the French Revolution, however, it was saved
          <br />from the revolutionaries by being carried by the Visitation nuns
          from Lyons to Venice. Francis de Sales was <br />beatified in 1661 by
          Pope Alexander VII, who then canonized him four years later. He was
          declared a Doctor of <br />the Church by Pope Pius IX in 1877.
