          Kuriakose Elias Chavara, C.M.I. (10 February 1805 - 3 January 1871) was
          an Indian Syro-Malabar Catholic
          <br />priest, philosopher and social reformer. He is the first canonised
          Catholic male saint of Indian origin <br />and belongs to the
          Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic Church based in the state of
          Kerala. He was <br />the co-founder and first Prior General of the first
          congregation for men in the Syro-Malabar Church, now <br />known as the
          Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (C.M.I.), and of a similar one for women,
          the Congregation of <br />the Mother of Carmel (C.M.C.). He is a pioneer
          in many fields.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Kuriakose Elias Chavara was born on 10 February 1805 at Kainakary,
          Kerala in a Nasrani Christian family
          <br />as the son of Iko (Kuriakose) Chavara and Mariam Thoppil. Nasranis
          are Saint Thomas Christians (also <br />known as Syriac Christians) who
          are the ancient Christians of Kerala baptised by Thomas the Apostle in
          <br />the first century. The name Kuriakose is derived from the Syriac
          Aramaic name Quriaqos. He was baptised <br />on 17 February 1805 at St.
          Joseph's Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Chennamkary. On 8 September 1805,
          Chavara <br />was dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary at St. Mary's Church,
          Vechoor. The Chavara family has derived from <br />the ancient Nasrani
          family Meenappally in Kainakary.
        </p>
        <h2>Later Life</h2>
        <p>
          Kuriakose Elias Chavara joined with two other priests, Palackal Thoma
          Malpan and Porukara Thoma Kathanar
          <br />
          to lead a monastic life. The name of the community they founded was
          Servants of Mary Immaculate. The <br />
          foundation for the first monastery at Mannanam was laid on 11 May 1831
          by Porukara Thomas Kathanar. Palackal <br />
          Malpan and Porukara Kathanar died in 1841 and 1846 respectively. On 8
          December 1855, Kuriakose Elias Chavara <br />
          and ten other priests took vows in the Carmelite tradition. He was
          nominated as the Prior General of Mannanam <br />
          monastery. The congregation became affiliated as a Third Order institute
          of the Order of Discalced Carmelites. <br />
          From that point on they used the postnominal initials of T.O.C.D.
        </p>
        <h2>Social reformer</h2>
        <p>
          Kuriakose Chavara started an institution for Sanskrit studies at
          Mannanam in 1846. A tutor belonging to
          <br />the Variar community was brought from Thrissur, to teach at this
          Sanskrit institution. After establishing <br />the Sanskrit institution
          in Mannanam, Chavara took the initiative to start a school in a nearby
          village <br />called Arpookara. On this Parappurath Varkey wrote in the
          Chronicles of the Mannanam monastery: "While the <br />work on the
          Mannanam School began, a place on the Arpookara Thuruthumali hill was
          located to build a <br />Chapeland school for the converts from the
          Pulaya caste." Chavara was the first Indian who not only <br />dared to
          admit the untouchables to schools but also provided them with Sanskrit
          education which was forbidden <br />to the lower castes, thereby
          challenging social bans based on caste, as early as the former part of
          the <br />19th century.
        </p>
        <h2>Congregations Founded</h2>
        <p>
          In co-operation with Palackal Thoma Malpan and Thoma Porukara, Kuriakose
          Elias Chavara founded an
          <br />Indian religious congregation for men, now known as the Carmelites
          of Mary Immaculate. Chavara took <br />religious vows on 8 December 1855
          and took the name of Kuriakose Elias of the Holy Family. Kuriakose
          <br />Elias Chavara was the Prior General of all the monasteries of the
          congregation from 1856 till his <br />death in 1871.He was commonly
          called under the name 'Common Prior'. The activities of the members
          <br />of CMI congregation under the leadership of Chavara created huge
          transformation in the society. This <br />made priests and people to
          request Chavara to open religious houses in their area. He established
          seven <br />new monasteries besides Mannanam. They are Koonammavu-1857,
          Elthuruth-(St. Aloysius College, Thrissur) <br />1858, Plasnal-1858,
          Vazhakulam-1859, Pulincunnu-1861, Ambazhakad-1868, and Mutholy-1870. In
          1864, The <br />Vicar Apostolic transferred St.Chavara to Koonammavu
          Monastery.
        </p>
        <h2>Prior Mango</h2>
        <p>
          Prior Mango is a variety of mango which Kuriakose Chavara popularised.
          It is named after him who was
          <br />endearingly called "Prior" based on his position as the Prior or
          head of the religious congregation. <br />At Mannanam monastery there
          was a mango tree which was planted and taken care of by Kuriakose
          Chavara. <br />He sent the mango seedlings to monasteries and convents
          and told the members: Please plant the sapling <br />of this sweet
          mango, which I name it as 'Dukran'(Orma = memory) in each of our
          monastery. "This is to <br />make you realize that myself and all men
          are weak and faltering and don't have long life even as these
          <br />mango trees which give sweet fruits." In a letter he wrote : "
          This Mango-tree (1870) and its seedlings <br />leave a loving
          patrimonial memory for us".
        </p>
        <h2>Death and Miracles</h2>
        <p>
          Kuriakose Elias Chavara died on 3 January 1871, aged 66, at Koonammavu.
          He was buried in St.Philomena's
          <br />Forane Church, Koonammavu. His body was later moved to St.
          Joseph's Monastery Church in Mannanam. His <br />memorial is celebrated
          on 3 January as per the Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar. whereas his
          memorial is <br />celebrated on 18 February as per the Roman Liturgical
          Calendar of the Latin Rite. The following were the <br />last words of
          Kuriakose Chavara: "Why are you sad? All God's people must die some day.
          My hour has come. <br />By the grace of God, I prepared myself for it
          since long." Scores of miraculous favours were reported by <br />the
          intercession of Kuriakose Chavara. Alphonsa of the Immaculate
          Conception, who later became the first <br />saint of India, has
          testified in 1936 that Kuriakose Elias Chavara had appeared to her twice
          during her <br />illness and relieved her suffering.
