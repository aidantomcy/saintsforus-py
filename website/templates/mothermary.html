          Mother Mary (8 September 18 BC-33 AD) was a first-century Galilean
          Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife
          <br />of Joseph and the mother of Lord Jesus Christ according to the
          Canonical Gospels and the Quran. The <br />Gospels of Matthew and Luke
          in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin. In Matthew
          <br />and Luke, she is betrothed to Joseph. According to Christian
          theology, she conceived Jesus through the <br />Holy Spirit while still
          a virgin. She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born.
          Catholic <br />and Eastern Christian teachings claim that at the end of
          her earthly life, God raised her body directly <br />into heaven; this
          is known in the Christian West as the Assumption of Mary.
        </p>
        <h2>Names and titles</h2>
        <p>
          In Christianity, Mary is commonly referred to as the Virgin Mary, in
          accordance with the belief that he
          <br />Holy Spirit impregnated her, thereby conceiving her first-born son
          Jesus miraculously. The word "until" <br />has inspired considerable
          analysis on whether Joseph and Mary produced siblings after the birth of
          Jesus <br />or not. Among her many other names and titles are the
          Blessed Virgin Mary (often abbreviated to "BVM", or <br />"BMV" after
          the Latin "Beata Maria Virgo"), Saint Mary (occasionally), the Mother of
          God (primarily in <br />Western Christianity), the Theotokos (primarily
          in Eastern Christianity), Our Lady (Medieval Italian: Madonna),
          <br />and Queen of Heaven (Regina caeli; see also here), although the
          title "queen of heaven" was for centuries <br />before used as an
          epithet for a number of ancient sky-goddesses, such as Nin-anna,
          Astarte, Ishtar and <br />Astoreth, the Canaanite sky-goddess worshipped
          during the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah's lifetime.
        </p>
        <h2>Birth of Jesus</h2>
        <p>
          According to the author of the gospel according to Luke, a decree of the
          Roman Emperor Augustus required
          <br />that Joseph return to his hometown of Bethlehem to register for a
          Roman census; see Census of Quirinius. <br />While he was there with
          Mary, she gave birth to Jesus; but because there was no place for them
          in the inn, <br />she used a manger as a cradle. After eight days, he
          was circumcised according to Jewish law and named "Jesus
          <br />(Yeshu'a), which means "Yahweh is salvation". After Mary continued
          in the "blood of her purifying" another <br />33 days, for a total of 40
          days, she brought her burnt offering and sin offering to the Temple in
          Jerusalem <br />[Luke 2:22] so the priest could make atonement for
          her.[Leviticus 12:1-8] They also presented Jesus - "As it <br />is
          written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall
          be called holy to the Lord" (Luke <br />2:23 other verses). After the
          prophecies of Simeon and the prophetess Anna in Luke 2:25-38, the family
          "returned <br />into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth".
        </p>
        <h2>In the life of Jesus</h2>
        <p>
          Mary was present when, at her suggestion, Jesus worked his first miracle
          during a wedding at Cana by
          <br />turning water into wine. [Jn 2:1-11] Subsequently, there are
          events when Mary is present along with James <br />Joseph, Simon, and
          Judas, called Jesus' brothers, and unnamed sisters. Following Jerome,
          the Church Fathers <br />interpreted the words translated as "brother"
          and "sister" as referring to close relatives. The hagiography <br />of
          Mary and the Holy Family can be contrasted with other material in the
          Gospels. These references include <br />an incident which can be
          interpreted as Jesus rejecting his family in the New Testament: "And his
          mother and <br />his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent
          in a message asking for him [â€¦] And looking at those who <br />sat in a
          circle around him, Jesus said, 'These are my mother and my brothers.
          Whoever does the will of God is <br />my brother, and sister, and
          mother'."
        </p>
        <h2>Feasts</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest feasts that relate to Mary grew out of the cycle of feasts
          that celebrated the Nativity of
          <br />Jesus. Given that according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 2:22-40),
          40 days after the birth of Jesus, along <br />with the Presentation of
          Jesus at the Temple Mary was purified according to Jewish customs, the
          Feast of <br />the Purification began to be celebrated by the 5th
          century, and became the "Feast of Simeon" in Byzantium. <br />In the 7th
          and 8th centuries, four more Marian feasts were established in Eastern
          Christianity. In the West, <br />a feast dedicated to Mary, just before
          Christmas was celebrated in the Churches of Milan and Ravenna in Italy
          <br />in the 7th century. The four Roman Marian feasts of Purification,
          Annunciation, Assumption and Nativity of Mary <br />were gradually and
          sporadically introduced into England by the 11th century.
