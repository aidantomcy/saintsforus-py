          John the Baptist (1st century BC - c.AD 30) was an itinerant preacher
          active in the area of the Jordan
          <br />River in the early 1st century AD. He is also known as John the
          Forerunner in Christianity, John the <br />Immerser in some Baptist
          Christian traditions, and Prophet Yahya in Islam. He is sometimes
          alternatively <br />referred to as John the Baptizer. John is mentioned
          by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and revered as <br />a major
          religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baha'i Faith, the Druze
          Faith, and Mandaeism. He is <br />considered to be a prophet of God by
          all of these faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian
          <br />denominations. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a
          messianic figure greater than himself, <br />and the Gospels portray
          John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus. Jesus himself identifies
          John as <br />"Elijah who is to come", which is a direct reference to
          the Book of Malachi (Malachi 4:5), that has been <br />confirmed by the
          angel who announced John's birth to his father, Zechariah. According to
          the Gospel of Luke, <br />John and Jesus were relatives.
        </p>
        <h2>Gospel Narratives</h2>
        <p>
          John the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the
          non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes.
          <br />The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John
          baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is <br />implied in John
          1:32. The Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfillment of a prophecy
          from the Book of Isaiah <br />(in fact, a conflation of texts from
          Isaiah, Malachi and Exodus) about a messenger being sent ahead, and a
          voice <br />crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing
          clothes of camel's hair, living on locusts and wild <br />honey. John
          proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says
          another will come after him who <br />will not baptize with water, but
          with the Holy Spirit. The Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same
          modified <br />quotation from Isaiah, moving the Malachi and Exodus
          material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus. <br />The
          description of John is taken directly from Mark ("clothing of camel's
          hair with a leather belt around his waist, <br />and his food was
          locusts and wild honey"), along with the proclamation that one was
          coming who would baptize with <br />the Holy Spirit "and fire". The
          Gospel of Luke adds an account of John's infancy, introducing him as the
          miraculous <br />son of Zechariah, an old priest, and his wife
          Elizabeth, who was past menopause and therefore unable to have
          <br />children.
        </p>
        <h2>The Baptism in the Jordan</h2>
        <p>
          John was a very wise and hard-working person. One day, while he was in
          the desert, God spoke to
          <br />him and told him about Jesus, the Saviour who will free people
          from their sins. Then, John preached <br />to people preparing for the
          coming of the Lord Jesus. John told people to change their ways. He said
          <br />those who had two sets of clothes were to give away one to the
          needy. He also told the tax collectors <br />not to collect extra money
          and the soldiers to avoid violence. All those who heard John wondered if
          <br />he was the saviour. To this, John said that he only baptisd with
          water and Jesus, who was coming, <br />will baptise them with the Holy
          Spirit. When Jesus came to the river Jordan, Jesus asked John to
          <br />baptise him too. But John refused as he knew that Jesus was the
          Son of God. John asked Jesus why He <br />had come to him to be
          baptised. Jesus explained that John had to baptise Him so that he
          fullfills <br />the Word of God. John obeyed Jesus and baptised him in
          the river. Just as Jesus was baptised, the <br />Heavens opened. The
          Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, rested upon Jesus. A voice from
          Heaven said, <br />"This is my beloved Son who will fulfill my promise
          to the people."
        </p>
        <h2>Imprisonment and Death</h2>
        <p>
          Princess Herodias, King Herod's daughter-in-law, hated John and
          requested for him to be thrown in
          <br />prison. King Herod knew Johhn was a holy man and liked listening
          to him, but he gave in to Herodias's <br />request and imprisoned John.
          John's disciples were disturbed. They asked Jesus whether He was truly
          <br />the Messiah. Jesus told them to tell John all the miracles that
          they saw him do. John was happy when <br />disciples told him about
          Jesus's miracles. Later, on King Herod's birthday, a large banquet was
          held <br />in his honour. At the banquet, Princess Herodias's daughter,
          Salome, danced before the guests. King <br />Herod was so pleased that
          he promised to give her whatever she requested. She requested for John
          the <br />Baptist's head on a plate, as her mother hated John and Salome
          wanted to please her mother. King Herod <br />was upset, but he had
          promised to give whatever she asked. He ordered the executioners to
          behead John. <br />They did so and brought John's head on a platter.
          Herod presented it to Salome and she gave it to her mother.
        </p>
        <h2>Relics</h2>
        <p>
          Matthew 14:12 records that "his disciples came and took away [John's]
          body and buried it." Theologian
          <br />Joseph Benson refers to a belief that they managed to do so
          because "it seems that the body had been <br />thrown over the prison
          walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias." The burial place
          of John <br />the Baptist's body has traditionally been said to be at
          the site of a Byzantine church later converted <br />into a mosque, the
          Nabi Yahya (Prophet John) Mosque in Sebastia, currently part of the
          State of Palestine, <br />and mention is made of his relics being
          honoured there around the middle of the 4th century. What became
          <br />of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine.
          Nicephorus and Symeon Metaphrastes say that <br />Herodias had it buried
          in the fortress of Machaerus, as had been said by Josephus. An Orthodox
          tradition <br />holds that the head relic was taken to the Mount of
          Olives, where it was twice buried and discovered, the <br />latter
          events giving rise to the Orthodox feast of the First and Second Finding
          of the Head of St. John <br />the Baptist. John the Baptist's right
          hand, without the index finger, with which he baptised Jesus, is
          <br />claimed to be in the Serbian Orthodox Cetinje monastery in
          Montenegro. Topkapi Palace, in Istanbul, claims <br />to have John's
          right hand index finger. The saint's left hand is allegedly preserved in
          the Armenian <br />Apostolic Church of St. John at Chinsurah, West
          Bengal, in India, where each year on "Chinsurah Day" in <br />January it
          blesses the Armenian Christians of Calcutta.
