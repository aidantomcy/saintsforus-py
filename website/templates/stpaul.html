          St. Paul (5 AD-67 AD) was an apostle (although not one of the Twelve
          Apostles) who taught the Gospel of
          <br />Christ to the 1st-century world. Paul is generally considered one
          of the most important figures of the <br />Apostolic Age, and from the
          mid-30s to the mid-50s AD, he founded several Christian communities in
          Asia <br />Minor and Europe. According to the New Testament book Acts of
          the Apostles, Paul participated in the <br />persecution of the
          "embryonic Christian Movement" in the area of Jerusalem, prior to his
          conversion. In <br />the narrative of the Acts, Paul was travelling on
          the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to <br />"arrest them
          and bring them back to Jerusalem" when the ascended Jesus appeared to
          him in a great bright <br />light. He was struck blind, but after three
          days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus. Paul then
          <br />began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and
          the Son of God. Approximately half of the <br />book of Acts deals with
          Paul's life and works.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          The two main sources of information that give access to the earliest
          segments of Paul's career are the
          <br />Book of Acts and the autobiographical elements of Paul's letters
          to the early Christian communities. <br />Paul was likely born between
          the years of 5 BC and 5 AD. The Book of Acts indicates that Paul was a
          Roman <br />citizen by birth, but Helmut Koester takes issue with the
          evidence presented by the text. He was from a <br />devout Jewish family
          based in the city of Tarsus. One of the larger centers of trade on the
          Mediterranean <br />coast and renowned for its university, Tarsus had
          been among the most influential cities in Asia Minor <br />since the
          time of Alexander the Great, who died in 323 BC. Paul referred to
          himself as being "of the stock <br />of Israel, of the tribe of
          Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee". The
          Bible <br />reveals very little about Paul's family. Acts quotes Paul
          referring to his family by saying he was "a Pharisee, <br />born of
          Pharisees". Paul's nephew, his sister's son, is mentioned in Acts 23:16.
          In Romans 16:7, he states <br />that his relatives, Andronicus and
          Junia, were Christians before he was and were prominent among the
          <br />Apostles.
        </p>
        <h2>Persecutor of early Christians</h2>
        <p>
          Paul says that prior to his conversion, he persecuted early Christians
          "beyond measure", more specifically
          <br />Hellenised diaspora Jewish members who had returned to the area of
          Jerusalem. According to James Dunn, the <br />Jerusalem community
          consisted of "Hebrews," Jews speaking both Aramaic and Greek, and
          "Hellenists," Jews <br />speaking only Greek, possibly diaspora Jews who
          had resettled in Jerusalem. Paul's initial persecution of
          <br />Christians probably was directed against these Greek-speaking
          "Hellenists" due to their anti-Temple attitude. <br />Within the early
          Jewish Christian community, this also set them apart from the "Hebrews"
          and their continuing <br />participation in the Temple cult.
        </p>
        <h2>Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          Paul's conversion can be dated to 31-36 by his reference to it in one of
          his letters. In Galatians
          <br />1:16, Paul writes that God "was pleased to reveal his son to me."
          In 1 Corinthians 15:8, as he lists <br />the order in which Jesus
          appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, Paul writes, "last of
          all, <br />as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also." According
          to the account in the Book of Acts, it <br />took place on the road to
          Damascus, where he reported having experienced a vision of the ascended
          Jesus. <br />The account says that "He fell to the ground and heard a
          voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why do you <br />persecute me?' He
          asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The reply came, 'I am Jesus, whom you are
          persecuting'." <br />According to the account in Act 9:1-22, he was
          blinded for three days and had to be led into Damascus <br />by the
          hand. During these three days, Saul took no food or water and spent his
          time in prayer to God. <br />When Ananias of Damascus arrived, he laid
          his hands on him and said: "Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] <br />Jesus,
          that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that
          thou mightest receive thy <br />sight, and be filled with the Holy
          Ghost." His sight was restored, he got up and was baptized. This story
          <br />occurs only in Acts, not in the Pauline epistles.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          The date of Paul's death is believed to have occurred after the Great
          Fire of Rome in July 64, but before
          <br />the last year of Nero's reign, in 68. The Second Epistle to
          Timothy states that Paul was arrested in Troad <br />and brought back to
          Rome, where he was imprisoned and put on trial; the Epistle was
          traditionally ascribed <br />to Paul, but today many scholars considered
          it to be pseudepigrapha, perhaps written by one of Paul's disciples.
          <br />Pope Clement I writes in his Epistle to the Corinthians that after
          Paul "had borne his testimony before the <br />rulers", he "departed
          from the world and went unto the holy place, having been found a notable
          pattern of <br />patient endurance." Ignatius of Antioch writes in his
          Epistle to the Ephesians that Paul was martyred, without <br />giving
          any further information.
        </p>
        <h2>Remains</h2>
        <p>
          According to further legend, Paul's body was buried outside the walls of
          Rome, at the second mile on the
          <br />Via Ostiensis, on the estate owned by a Christian woman named
          Lucina. It was here, in the fourth century, <br />that the Emperor
          Constantine the Great built a first church. Then, between the fourth and
          fifth centuries, <br />it was considerably enlarged by the Emperors
          Valentinian I, Valentinian II, Theodosius I, and Arcadius. <br />The
          present-day Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls was built there in
          the early 19th century. Caius <br />in his Disputation Against Proclus
          (198 AD) mentions this of the places in which the remains of the
          apostles <br />Peter and Paul were deposited: "I can point out the
          trophies of the apostles. For if you are willing to go <br />to the
          Vatican or to the Ostian Way, you will find the trophies of those who
          founded this Church".
