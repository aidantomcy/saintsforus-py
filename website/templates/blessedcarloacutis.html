        Carlo Acutis (3 May 1991-12 October 2006) was an English-born Italian
        Catholic youth and amateur <br />
        computer programmer, who is best known for documenting Eucharistic
        Miracles around the world and <br />
        cataloguing them onto a
        <a href="http://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/liste/list.html"
          >website</a
        >
        that he created before his death from leukemia. He was noted for his
        <br />
        cheerfulness, computer skills and deep devotion to the Eucharist, which
        was a core theme of his life. <br />
        Carlo Acutis was born to a wealthy Italian family with Irish and Polish
        roots. His baptism took place <br />
        on 18 May 1991 at the Church of Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea. Acutis
        used to attend Mass daily and <br />
        and never forgot to pray to Mother Mary by saying the rosary daily. He
        died at the tender age of 15 <br />
        and was Beatified on 10 October 2020.
      </p>

      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        Carlo Acutis was born in London on 3 May 1991 to a wealthy Italian
        family. In 1995, when Acutis was four
        <br />years old, his maternal grandfather died and was said to have
        appeared to him in a dream asking to be prayed <br />for. When the child
        evinced a precocious interest in religious practice, his questions were
        answered by the <br />family's Polish baby-sitter. Three years later he
        requested to receive his First Communion at the age of seven.
        <br />After consulting a prelate and providing instruction, the family
        arranged this at the convent of Sant'Ambrogio <br />ad Nemus. After that
        he made the effort, either before or after Mass, to reflect before the
        tabernacle. Acutis <br />became a frequent communicant and would make a
        weekly confession. He is said to have had several models as guides
        <br />for his life, especially Francis of Assisi, as well as Francisco
        and Jacinta Marto, Dominic Savio, Tarcisius, <br />and Bernadette
        Soubirous.
      </p>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Acutis's mother, Antonia, is said to attribute to his intercession the
        fact that, at the age of 44, she
        <br />gave birth to twins, born exactly four years to the day after his
        death. Following the Catholic Church's <br />recognition of a miracle in
        2020, attributed to Acutis, Antonia told the press that her son had
        appeared <br />to her in dreams saying that he will not only be
        beatified but also canonised a saint in the future. In <br />memory of
        Acutis, bishops Raffaello Martinelli and Angelo Comastri have helped to
        organize a travelling <br />photo exhibition of all the Eucharistic
        miracle sites. It has since travelled to dozens of different
        <br />countries across five continents. On 15th December 2020, under the
        provisions of Canon Law, Archbishop <br />Bernard established a new
        parish in the Archdiocese of Birmingham under the patronage of the
        Blessed <br />Carlo Acutis. The parish incorporates the three churches
        of St Peter & Paul, St Michael and St Bernadette <br />in Wolverhampton.
      </p>
      <h2>Beatification</h2>
      <p>
        The call for him to be beatified began not long after Acutis's death.
        The campaign gained momentum in 2013
        <br />after he was named a Servant of God, the first stage on the path
        towards sainthood. The Lombardy Episcopal <br />Conference approved the
        petition for the official canonization cause to proceed at a meeting in
        2013. The <br />opening of the diocesan investigation was held on 15
        February 2013, with Cardinal Angelo Scola inaugurating <br />the
        process, and concluding it on 24 November 2016. The formal introduction
        to the cause took place on 13 <br />May 2013, and Acutis became titled a
        "Servant of God". Pope Francis next confirmed his life as one of heroic
        <br />virtue on 5 July 2018, and declared him Venerable.
