          St. Clare of Assisi (16 July 1194-11 August 1253) is an Italian saint
          and one of the first followers
          <br />of Francis of Assisi. As a child, Clare was devoted to prayer.
          Although there is no mention of this <br />in any historical record, it
          is assumed that Clare was to be married in line with the family
          tradition. <br />However, as a teenager, she heard Francis preach during
          a Lenten service in the Church of San Giorgio <br />at Assisi and asked
          him to help her live according to the Gospel. On the evening of Palm
          Sunday, 20 March <br />1212, she left her father's house and accompanied
          by her aunt Bianca and another companion, proceeded to <br />the Chapel
          of Poriuncula to meet Francis. There, her hair was cut, and she
          exchanged her rich gown for a <br />plain robe and veil. She founded the
          Order of Poor Ladies, a monastic religious order for women in the
          <br />Franciscan tradition, and wrote their Rule of Life, the first set
          of monastic guidelines known to have <br />been written by a woman.
          Following her death, the order she founded was renamed in her honour as
          the Order <br />of Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the Poor
          Clares.
        </p>
        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
          Francis placed Clare in the convent of the Benedictine nuns of San
          Paulo, near Bastia. Her father
          <br />attempted to force her to return home. She clung to the altar of
          the church and threw aside her veil <br />to show her cropped hair. She
          resisted each attempt, professing that she would have no other husband
          <br />but Jesus Christ. In order to provide the greater solitude Clare
          desired, a few days later Francis sent <br />her to Sant' Angelo in
          Panzo, another monastery of the Benedictine nuns on one of the flanks of
          Subasio. <br />Clare was soon joined by her sister Catarina, who took
          the name Agnes. They remained with the Benedictines <br />until a small
          dwelling was built for them next to the church of San Damiano, which
          Francis had repaired <br />some years earlier. Other women joined them,
          and they were known as the "Poor Ladies of San Damiano". They
          <br />lived a simple life of poverty, austerity and seclusion from the
          world, according to a Rule which Francis <br />gave them as a Second
          Order (Poor Clares).
        </p>
        <h2>The Order of Saint Clare</h2>
        <p>
          San Damiano became the centre of Clare's new religious order, which was
          known in her lifetime as the "Order
          <br />of Poor Ladies of San Damiano". San Damiano is traditionally
          considered the first house of this order; it <br />may have been
          affiliated with an existing network of women's religious houses
          organised by Hugolino (who <br />later became Pope Gregory IX). Hugolino
          wanted San Damiano as part of the order he founded because of the
          <br />prestige of Clare's monastery. San Damiano emerged as the most
          important house in the order, and Clare became <br />its undisputed
          leader. By 1263, just ten years after Clare's death, the order had
          become known as the Order <br />of Saint Clare. In 1228, when Gregory IX
          offered Clare a dispensation from the vow of strict poverty, she
          <br />replied: "I need to be absolved from my sins, but not from the
          obligation of following Christ." Accordingly, <br />the Pope granted
          them the Privilegium Pauperitatis â€” that nobody could oblige them to
          accept any possession.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          On 9 August 1253, two days before her death, the papal bull Solet
          annuere of Pope Innocent IV confirmed
          <br />that Clare's rule would serve as the governing rule for Clare's
          Order of Poor Ladies. Her remains were <br />interred at the chapel of
          San Giorgio while a church to hold her remains was being constructed. At
          her <br />funeral, Pope Innocent IV insisted the friars perform the
          Office for the Virgin Saints as opposed to the <br />Office for the
          Dead. This move by Pope Innocent ensured that the canonization process
          for Clare would <br />begin shortly after her funeral. Pope Innocent was
          cautioned by multiple advisers against having the Office <br />for the
          Virgin Saints performed at Clare's funeral. The most vocal of these
          advisers was Cardinal Raynaldus <br />who would later become Pope
          Alexander IV, who in two years time would canonize Clare. At Pope
          Innocent's <br />request the canonization process for Clare began
          immediately. While the whole process took two years, the
          <br />examination of Clare's miracles took just six days. On 26
          September 1255, Pope Alexander IV canonized Clare <br />as Saint Clare
          of Assisi.
        </p>
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Clare was canonized on 26 September 1255 by Pope Alexander IV, and her
          feast day was immediately inserted
          <br />in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 12 August, the
          day after her death, as 11 August was <br />already assigned to Saints
          Tiburtius and Susanna, two 3rd-century Roman martyrs. The celebration
          was ranked <br />as a Double (as in the Tridentine Calendar) or, in the
          terminology adopted in 1960, a Third-Class Feast (as <br />in the
          General Roman Calendar of 1960). The 1969 calendar revision removed the
          feast of Tiburtius and Susanna <br />from the calendar, finally allowing
          the memorial of Saint Clare to be celebrated on 11 August, the day of
          her <br />death. Construction of the Basilica di Santa Chiara began a
          year after Clare's canonization, and her remains <br />were transferred
          there on 3 October 1260 from the church of St George, also in Assisi.
          Her bones are now in <br />the crypt at the Basilica, having been
          rediscovered in 1850.
