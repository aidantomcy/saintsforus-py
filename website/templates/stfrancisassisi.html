          St. Francis of Assisi (1181 or 1182-3 October 1226) was an Italian
          Catholic Friar, deacon, <br />mystic and preacher. He founded the
          men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order <br />of Saint Clare,
          the Third Order of St. Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land.
          Francis is <br />one of the most venerated religious figures in
          Christianity. He was canonized by Pope <br />Gregory IX on 16 July
          1228. Francis is known for his love of the Eucharist. In 1223,
          Francis <br />Francis arranged for the first Christmas Live nativity
          scene.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Francis of Assisi was born in late 1181 or early 1182, one of
          several children of an <br />Italian father, Pietro di Bernardone
          dei Moriconi, a prosperous silk merchant, and a <br />French mother,
          Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a
          <br />noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on
          business when Francis was <br />born in Assisi, and Pica had him
          baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro <br />took
          to calling his son Francesco ("Free man", "Frenchman"), possibly in
          honor of his <br />commercial success and enthusiasm for all things
          French.
        </p>

        <h2>Founding of the Franciscan Orders</h2>
        <p>
          One morning in February 1208, Francis was taking part in a Mass in
          the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, <br />near which he had by
          then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the
          "Commissioning of the Twelve" <br />from the Book of Matthew. The
          disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand.
          Francis <br />was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty.
          Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then <br />worn by
          the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around himself with a
          knotted rope and went about exhorting <br />the people of the
          countryside to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis's
          preaching to ordinary people <br />was unusual as he had no license
          to do so. His example attracted others. Within a year Francis had
          eleven <br />followers. The brothers lived a simple life in the
          deserted lazar house of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they <br />spent
          much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of
          Umbria, making a deep impression upon <br />their hearers by their
          earnest exhortations.
        </p>
        <h2>Travels</h2>
        <p>
          Determined to bring the Gospel to all peoples and let God convert
          them, Francis sought on several occasions <br />to take his message
          out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem,
          but was shipwrecked <br />by a storm on the Dalmatian coast, forcing
          him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of
          <br />the mountain of La Verna (Alverna) as a gift from Count
          Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as "eminently <br />suitable for
          whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind". The
          mountain would become one of <br />his favourite retreats for
          prayer. In the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but an illness
          forced him <br />to break off his journey while in Spain.
        </p>
        <h2>Reorganization of the Franciscan Order</h2>
        <p>
          The growing order of friars was divided into provinces; groups were
          sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and
          <br />Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the
          martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned <br />to
          Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by
          the pope as the protector of the order. <br />Another reason for
          Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at
          an unprecedented rate <br />compared to previous religious orders,
          but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this
          growth <br />and had little more to govern it than Francis' example
          and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared <br />a
          new and more detailed Rule, the "First Rule" or "Rule Without a
          Papal Bull" (Regula prima, Regula non bullata), <br />which again
          asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it
          also introduced greater institutional <br />structure, though this
          was never officially endorsed by the pope.
        </p>
        <h2>Stigmata, final days, and sainthood</h2>
        <p>
          While he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day
          fast in preparation for Michaelmas (29 September),
          <br />Francis is said to have had a vision on or about 13 September
          1224, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as a <br />result of
          which he received the stigmata. Brother Leo, who had been with
          Francis at the time, left a clear and simple <br />account of the
          event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata.
          "Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, <br />a six-winged angel on a
          cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ."
          Suffering from these stigmata <br />and from trachoma, Francis
          received care in several cities (Siena, Cortona, Nocera) to no
          avail. In the end, he was brought <br />back to a hut next to the
          Porziuncola. Here he spent his last days dictating his spiritual
          testament. He died on the evening <br />of Saturday, 3 October 1226,
          singing Psalm 141, <em>"Voce mea ad Dominum"</em>.
        </p>
        <h2>Patronage</h2>
        <p>
          On 18 June 1939, Pope Pius XII named Francis a joint Patron Saint of
          Italy along with Catherine of Siena
          <br />with the apostolic letter "Licet Commissa". Pope Pius also
          mentioned the two saints in the laudative discourse <br />he
          pronounced on 5 May 1949, in the Church of Santa Maria Sopra
          Minerva. Francis is the patron of animals, merchants, <br />and
          ecology. He is also considered the patron against dying alone;
          against fire; patron of the Franciscan Order and <br />Catholic
          Action; of families, peace, needleworkers, and merchants, and a
          number of religious congregations. He is the <br />patron of many
          churches and other locations around the world, including: Italy; San
          Pawl il-Bahar, Malta; Freising, <br />Germany; Lancaster, England;
          Kottapuram, India; San Francisco de Malabon, Philippines (General
          Trias City); San Francisco, <br />California; Santa Fe, New Mexico;
          Colorado; Salina, Kansas; Metuchen, New Jersey; and Quibdó,
          Colombia.
