          St. Aidan of Lindisfarne (Around 590-31 August 651) was an Irish monk
          and missionary credited with
          <br />converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in Northumbria. He
          founded a monastic cathedral on the <br />island of Lindisfarne, known
          as Lindisfarne Priory, served as its first bishop, and travelled
          ceaselessly <br />throughout the countryside, spreading the gospel to
          both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the <br />socially disenfranchised
          (including children and slaves). He is known as the Apostle of
          Northumbria and <br />is recognised as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox
          Church, the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion <br />and others.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          St. Aidan, the Apostle of Northumbria, was the founder and first bishop
          of the Lindisfarne island monastery
          <br />in England. He is credited with restoring Christianity to
          Northumbria. Aidan is the Anglicised form of the <br />original Old
          Irish Aedán, Modern Irish Aodhán (meaning "little fiery one"). Possibly
          born in Connacht, Aidan <br />was originally a monk at the monastery on
          the Island of Iona, founded by St Columba. In the years prior to
          <br />Aidan's mission, Christianity, which had been propagated
          throughout Britain but not Ireland by the Roman Empire, <br />was being
          largely displaced by Anglo-Saxon paganism. In the monastery of Iona
          (founded by Columba of the Irish Church), <br />the religion soon found
          one of its principal exponents in Oswald of Northumbria, a noble youth
          who had been <br />raised there as a king in exile since 616.
        </p>

        <h2>Missionary efforts</h2>
        <p>
          Allying himself with the pious king, Aidan chose the island of
          Lindisfarne, which was close to the royal
          <br />castle at Bamburgh, as the seat of his diocese An inspired
          missionary, Aidan would walk from one village <br />to another, politely
          conversing with the people he saw and slowly interesting them in
          Christianity: in <br />this, he followed the early apostolic model of
          conversion, by offering "them first the milk of gentle <br />doctrine,
          to bring them by degrees, while nourishing them with the Divine Word, to
          the true understanding <br />and practice of the more advanced
          precepts." By patiently talking to the people on their own level (and by
          <br />taking an active interest in their lives and communities), Aidan
          and his monks slowly restored Christianity <br />to the Northumbrian
          countryside. King Oswald, who after his years of exile had a perfect
          command of Gaelic, <br />often had to translate for Aidan and his monks,
          who did not speak English at first.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          When Oswald died in 642, Aidan received continued support from King
          Oswine of Deira and the two became
          <br />close friends. As such, the monk's ministry continued relatively
          unchanged until the rise of pagan <br />hostilities in 651. At that
          time, a pagan army attacked Bamburgh and attempted to set its walls
          ablaze. <br />According to legend, Aidan saw the black smoke from his
          cell at Lindisfarne Abbey, immediately recognized <br />its cause, and
          knelt in prayer for the fate of the city. Miraculously, the winds
          abruptly reversed their <br />course, blowing the conflagration towards
          the enemy, which convinced them that the capital city was defended
          <br />by potent spiritual forces. Around this time, Oswine was betrayed
          and murdered. Two weeks later Aidan died, <br />on 31 August 651.
        </p>
        <h2>Legacy and veneration</h2>
        <p>
          After his death, Aidan's body was buried at Lindisfarne, beneath the
          abbey that he had helped found.
          <br />Though his popularity waned in the coming years, "in the 11th
          century Glastonbury monks obtained some <br />supposed relics of Aidan;
          through their influence Aidan's feast appears in the early Wessex
          calendars, <br />which provide the main evidence for his cult after the
          age of Bede." His feast is celebrated on the <br />anniversary of his
          death, 31 August. Reflecting his Irish origins, his Scottish monasticism
          and his <br />ministry to the English, Aidan has been proposed as a
          possible patron saint for the whole of the <br />United Kingdom.
