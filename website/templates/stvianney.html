          St. Vianney (8 May 1786-4 August 1859) was a French Catholic priest who
          is venerated in the Catholic
          <br />Church as a saint and the patron saint of parish priests. He is
          often referred to as the "Cure d'Ars" <br />(i.e. the parish priest of
          Ars) and is internationally known for his priestly and pastoral work in
          his <br />parish in Ars, France, because of the radical spiritual
          transformation of the community and its surroundings. <br />Catholics
          attribute this to his saintly life, mortification, persevering ministry
          in the sacrament of <br />confession and ardent devotion to the Blessed
          Virgin Mary. Vianney was born in the French town of Dardilly <br />and
          was baptized on the same day. His parents, Matthieu Vianney and Marie,
          had six children, of whom St. <br />Vianney was the fourth. The Vianneys
          were devout Catholics who helped the poor. Vianney's paternal
          <br />grandparents once gave hospitality to St. Benedict Joseph Labre,
          the patron saint of the homeless, who <br />passed through Dardilly on
          his pilgrimage to Rome in 1770.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          By 1790, the anticlerical Terror phase of the French Revolution forced
          many loyal priests to hide from
          <br />the regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their parish.
          Even though to do so had been declared <br />illegal, the Vianneys
          traveled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated on the run.
          Realizing that <br />such priests risked their lives day by day, Vianney
          began to look upon them as heroes. He received his <br />First Communion
          catiterm instructions in a private home from two nuns whose communities
          had been dissolved <br />during the Revolution. He made his first
          communion at the age of 13 in a neighbor's kitchen; during the
          <br />Mass, the windows were covered so that the light of the candles
          could not be seen from the outside.
        </p>
        <h2>Cure (priest) of Ars</h2>
        <p>
          In 1818, shortly after the death of Balley, Vianney was appointed parish
          priest of the parish of Ars,
          <br />a town of 230 inhabitants. When Vianney's bishop first assigned
          him to Ars, he got lost trying to find <br />the town. Two young men
          tending flocks in the fields pointed him in the right direction. With
          Catherine <br />Lassagne and Benedicta Lardet, he established La
          Providence, a home for girls. As parish priest, Vianney <br />realized
          that the Revolution's aftermath had resulted in religious ignorance and
          indifference, due to the <br />devastation wrought on the Catholic
          Church in France. At the time, Sundays in rural areas were spent working
          <br />in the fields, or dancing and drinking in taverns. Vianney spent
          time in the confessional and gave homilies <br />against blasphemy and
          paganic dancing. If his parishioners did not give up this dancing, he
          refused them <br />absolution.
        </p>
        <h2>Later years</h2>
        <p>
          Vianney came to be known internationally, and people from distant places
          began travelling to consult him
          <br />as early as 1827. "By 1855, the number of pilgrims had reached
          20,000 a year. During the last ten years <br />of his life, he spent 16
          to 18 hours a day in the confessional. Even the bishop forbade him to
          attend the <br />annual retreats of the diocesan clergy because of the
          souls awaiting him yonder". He spent at least 11 or <br />12 hours a day
          in the confessional during winter, and up to 16 in the summer. In his
          article "How does the <br />Church Respond to Suicide?" Shaun McAfee
          references an incident described in the book Cure of Ars: "...a woman
          <br />...told....Vianney that she was devastated because her husband had
          committed suicide. She wanted to approach <br />the great priest but his
          line often lasted for hours and she could not reach him. She was ready
          to give up <br />and in a moment of mystical insight that only a great
          saint can receive,...Vianney exclaimed through the crowd, <br />"He is
          saved!" The woman was incredulous so the saint repeated, stressing each
          word, "I tell you he is saved. <br />He is in Purgatory, and you must
          pray for him. Between the parapet of the bridge and the water he had
          time to <br />make an act of contrition."
        </p>
        <h2>Death and veneration</h2>
        <p>
          On 4 August 1859, Vianney died at the age of 73. The bishop presided
          over his funeral with 300 priests
          <br />and more than 6,000 people in attendance. Before he was buried,
          Vianney's body was fitted with a wax <br />mask. On 3 October 1874 Pope
          Pius IX proclaimed him "venerable"; on 8 January 1905, Pope Pius X
          declared <br />him Blessed and proposed him as a model to the parochial
          clergy. In 1925 John Mary Vianney was canonized <br />by Pope Pius XI,
          who in 1929 made him patron saint of parish priests. In 1928 his feast
          day was inserted <br />into the General Roman Calendar for celebration
          on 9 August. Pope John XXIII's 1960 revision, in which the <br />Vigil
          of Saint Lawrence had a high rank, moved the feast to 8 August. Finally,
          the 1969 revision placed it <br />on 4 August, the day of his death.
