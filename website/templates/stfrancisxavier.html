          St. Francis Xavier (7 April 1506-3 December 1552) was a Spanish Catholic
          priest, missionary <br />and saint from Navarre; he was the co-founder
          of the Society of Jesus. Born in Javier, Kingdom of <br />Navarre, he
          was a companion of Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits
          who took vows <br />of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris, in
          1534. He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly <br />in the
          Portuguese Empire of the time, and was influential in evangalization
          work, most notably in India. <br />He was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25
          October 1619 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Francis Xavier was born in the royal castle of Xavier, in the Kingdom of
          Navarre, on 7 April 1506
          <br />according to a family register. He was the youngest son of Juan de
          Jasso y Atondo, seneschal of <br />Xavier castle, who belonged to a
          prosperous farming family and had acquired a doctorate in law at
          <br />the University of Bologna. Basque was his mother tongue. Juan
          later became a privy counsellor <br />and finance minister to King John
          III of Navarre (Jean d'Albret). Francis's mother was Dona <br />Maria de
          Azpilcueta y Aznarez, sole heiress of two noble Navarrese families. He
          was through her <br />related to the great theologian and philosopher
          Martin de Azpilcueta. In 1512, Ferdinand, King of <br />Aragon and
          regent of Castile, invaded Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18
          years. Three <br />years later, Francis's father died when Francis was
          only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers <br />participated in a
          failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the
          kingdom.

        <h2>Missionary work</h2>
        <p>
          On 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church of
          Saint Denis (now Saint Pierre de
          <br />Montmartre), on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris. They
          were Francis, Ignatius of Loyola, Alfonso <br />Salmeron, Diego Lainez,
          Nicolas Bobadilla from Spain, Peter Faber from Savoy, and Simao
          Rodrigues from <br />Portugal. They made private vows of poverty,
          chastity, and obedience to the Pope, and also vowed to go to <br />the
          Holy Land to convert infidels. Francis began his study of theology in
          1534 and was ordained <br />on 24 June 1537. In 1539, after long
          discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order,
          <br />the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). Ignatius's plan for the order
          was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.

        <h2>Burials and Relics</h2>
        <p>
          Xavier was first buried on a beach at Shangchuan Island, Taishan,
          Guangdong. His body was taken from the
          <br />
          island in February 1553 and temporarily buried in St. Paul's Church in
          Portuguese Malacca on 22 March 1553. <br />
          An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial.
          Pereira came back from Goa, removed the <br />
          corpse shortly after 15 April 1553, and moved it to his house. On 11
          December 1553, Xavier's body was shipped <br />
          to Goa. The body is now in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa, where it
          was placed in a glass container encased <br />
          in a silver casket on 2 December 1637. This casket, constructed by Goan
          silversmiths between 1636 and 1637, <br />
          was an exemplary blend of Italian and Indian aesthetic sensibilities.
          There are 32 silver plates on all four sides <br />
          of the casket, depicting different episodes from the life of Xavier.
        </p>
        <h2>Veneration</h2>
        <p>
          Francis Xavier was beatified by Paul V on 25 October 1619, and was
          canonized by Gregory XV on 12 March
          <br />1622, at the same time as Ignatius Loyola. Pius XI proclaimed him
          the "Patron of Catholic Missions". <br />His feast day is 3 December.
          Saint Francis Xavier's relics are kept in a silver casket, elevated
          inside <br />the Bom Jesus Basilica and are exposed (being brought to
          ground level) generally every ten years, but <br />this is
          discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November
          2014 at the XVII Solemn <br />Exposition. The display closed on 4
          January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from
          <br />21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005. Relics of Saint Francis Xavier
          are also found in the Espirito Santo <br />(Holy Spirit) Church, Margao,
          in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier),
          Batpal, <br />Canacona, Goa, and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais,
          Panjim.
