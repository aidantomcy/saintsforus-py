          St. Nicholas (15 March 270-6 December 343), also known as Nicholas of
          Bari, was an early Christian Bishop
          <br />of Greek Descent from the maritime city of Myra in Asia Minor
          during the time of the Roman Empire. Because <br />of the many miracles
          attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the
          Wonderworker. St. <br />Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors,
          merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children,
          <br />brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people and students in various
          cities and countries around Europe. His <br />reputation evolved among
          the faithful, as was common among early Christian Saints, and his
          legendary habit <br />of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional
          model of Santa Claus through Saint Nicholas.
        </p>
        <h2>Family and background</h2>
        <p>
          Accounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but
          modern historians disagree
          <br />regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical
          fact. Traditionally, Nicholas <br />was born in the city of Patara
          (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor
          <br />in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians.
          According to some accounts, his parents <br />were named Epiphanius and
          Johanna, but, according to others, they were named Theophanes and Nonna.
          <br />In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of
          Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his <br />nephew's calling, Nicholas's
          uncle ordained him as a priest.
        </p>
        <h2>Generosity and travels</h2>
        <p>
          After his parents died, Nicholas is said to have distributed their
          wealth to the poor. In his most famous
          <br />exploit, which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite's
          Life of Saint Nicholas, Nicholas heard of <br />a devout man who had
          once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the "plotting and
          envy of Satan." <br />The man could not afford proper dowries for his
          three daughters. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided <br />to
          help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to
          save them the humiliation of accepting <br />charity), he went to the
          house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins
          through the <br />window opening into the house. The father immediately
          arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after <br />her wedding,
          Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at
          night.
        </p>
        <h2>Bishop of Myra</h2>
        <p>
          After visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop of
          Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's
          <br />uncle, had recently died and the priests in the city had decided
          that the first priest to enter the church <br />that morning would be
          made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore
          proclaimed the new <br />bishop. He is said to have been imprisoned and
          tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor <br />Diocletian
          (ruled 284-305), but was released under the orders of the Emperor
          Constantine the Great (ruled <br />306-337). This story sounds
          plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore
          unlikely <br />to be historical. One of the earliest attested stories of
          Saint Nicholas is one in which he saves three innocent <br />men from
          execution. According to Michael the Archimandrite, three innocent men
          were condemned to death by the <br />governor Eustathius. As they were
          about to be executed, Nicholas appeared, pushed the executioner's sword
          to the <br />ground, released them from their chains, and angrily
          chastised a juror who had accepted a bribe.
        </p>
        <h2>Other Reputed Miracles</h2>
        <p>
          One story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured
          three little children into his house,
          <br />where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure,
          planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, <br />visiting the region to
          care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and resurrected the
          pickled children <br />by making the Sign of the Cross. Jona Lendering
          states that the story is "without any historical value." Adam <br />C.
          English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children
          is a late medieval addition to the <br />legendary biography of Saint
          Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest Lives. Though
          this story <br />seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it
          was tremendously popular throughout the late Middle Ages <br />and the
          Early Modern Period and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted
          in stained glass windows, wood <br />panel paintings, tapestries, and
          frescoes.
        </p>
        <h2>Relics</h2>
        <p>
          It has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was
          originally buried in his home town of Myra,
          <br />where his relics are later known to have been kept, but some
          recent archaeological evidence indicates that <br />Saint Nicholas may
          have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the
          highest point on the <br />small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty
          miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas's name is
          <br />painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the island
          was known as "Saint Nicholas Island" and <br />today it is known in
          Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning "Island of Boats", in reference to
          Saint Nicholas's <br />traditional role as the patron saint of
          seafarers. The church was built in the fourth century, around the
          <br />time of Nicholas's death, and is typical of saints' shrines from
          that time period. Nicholas was the only <br />major saint associated
          with that part of Turkey. The church where historians believe he was
          originally <br />entombed is at the western end of the great
          processional way.
