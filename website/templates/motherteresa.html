          Mother Teresa (26 August 1910-5 September 1997) was an Albanian Indian
          Roman Catholic nun and missionary.
          <br />She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia), then
          part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman <br />Empire. After living in
          Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where
          she lived <br />for most of her life. In 1950, Teresa founded the
          Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation
          <br />that had over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries in 2012.
          The congregation manages homes for people <br />who are dying of
          HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis. It also runs soup kitchens,
          dispensaries, mobile clinics, <br />children's and family counselling
          programmes and orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity,
          poverty <br />and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give
          wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Teresa was born Anjeze Gonxhe (or Gonxha) Bojaxhiu Anjeze is a cognate
          of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud"
          <br />or "little flower" in Albanian) on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar
          Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire <br />(now the capital of
          North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje, the day after her birth.
          She later considered <br />27 August, the day she was baptised, her
          "true birthday". She was the youngest child of Nikolle and Dranafile
          <br />Bojaxhiu (Bernai). Her father, who was involved in
          Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died <br />in 1919
          when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo),
          however, his family was from <br />Mirdita (present-day Albania). Her
          mother may have been from a village near Gjakova. According to a
          biography <br />by Joan Graff Clucas, Teresa was in her early years when
          she was fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries <br />and
          their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should
          commit herself to religious life. <br />Her resolve strengthened on 15
          August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of
          Vitina-Letnice, <br />where she often went on pilgrimages.
        </p>
        <h2>Missionaries of Charity</h2>
        <p>
          On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as
          "the call within the call" when she
          <br />travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from
          Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to <br />leave the convent and
          help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would
          have been to <br />break the faith." Joseph Langford later wrote,
          "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just <br />become
          Mother Teresa". She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,
          replacing her traditional Loreto <br />habit with a simple, white cotton
          sari with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent
          several <br />months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy
          Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. She <br />founded a school
          in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.
          At the beginning of <br />1949 Teresa was joined in her effort by a
          group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious
          <br />community helping the "poorest among the poor".
        </p>
        <h2>International charity</h2>
        <p>
          Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By
          faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my
          <br />calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely
          to the Heart of Jesus." Fluent in five <br />languages - Bengali,
          Albanian, Serbian, English and Hindi - she made occasional trips outside
          India for <br />humanitarian reasons. At the height of the Siege of
          Beirut in 1982, Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in <br />a front-line
          hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire between the Israeli army
          and Palestinian guerrillas. <br />Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she
          travelled through the war zone to the hospital to evacuate the young
          <br />patients. When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in
          the late 1980s, Teresa expanded her efforts <br />to Communist countries
          which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of
          projects, undeterred <br />by criticism of her stands against abortion
          and divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a
          <br />smile and do your own work." She visited Armenia after the 1988
          earthquake and met with Soviet Premier <br />Nikolai Ryzhkov.
        </p>
        <h2>Declining health and death</h2>
        <p>
          Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting Pope
          John Paul II. Following a second
          <br />attack in 1989, she received an pacemaker. In 1991, after a bout
          of pneumonia in Mexico, she had additional <br />heart problems.
          Although Teresa offered to resign as head of the Missionaries of
          Charity, in a secret <br />ballot the sisters of the congregation voted
          for her to stay and she agreed to continue. On 13 March 1997,
          <br />Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of Charity, and she
          died on 5 September, as news was already <br />overshadowed on the death
          of Princess Diana a few days earlier. At the time of her death, the
          Missionaries <br />of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and an associated
          brotherhood of 300 members operating 610 missions in 123
          <br />countries. These included hospices and homes for people with
          HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis, soup kitchens, <br />children's-and
          family-counselling programmes, orphanages and schools. The Missionaries
          of Charity were aided <br />by co-workers numbering over one million by
          the 1990s.
