          St. John Paul II (18 May 1920-2 April 2005) was the head of the Catholic
          Church and sovereign of the Vatican
          <br />City state from 1978 until his death in 2005. He was elected Pope
          by the second papal conclave of 1978, which <br />was called after Pope
          John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI,
          died after 33 days <br />of being named the Pope. Cardinal Wojtyla was
          elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of
          <br />his predecessor in tribute to him. John Paul II is recognized as
          helping to end Communist rule in his native <br />Poland and the rest of
          Europe. He significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with
          Judaism, Islam <br />and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Born in Poland,
          John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI <br />in the
          16th century and the second-longest-serving pope in modern history.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Karol Jozef Wojtyla was born in the Polish town of Wadowice. He was the
          youngest of three children born
          <br />to Karol Wojtyla (1879-1941), an ethnic Pole, and Emilia
          Kaczorowska (1884-1929), who was of distant <br />Lithuanian heritage.
          Emilia, who was a schoolteacher, died from a heart attack and kidney
          failure in 1929 <br />when Wojtyla was eight years old. His elder sister
          Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his <br />brother
          Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior. Edmund's work as
          a physician eventually led <br />to his death from scarlet fever, a loss
          that affected Wojtyla deeply. Wojtyla was baptized a month after his
          <br />birth, made his First Communion at the age of 9, and was confirmed
          at the age of 18. As a boy, Wojtyla was <br />athletic, often playing
          football as goalkeeper. During his childhood, Wojtyla had contact with
          the large Jewish <br />community of Wadowice. School football games were
          often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and <br />Wojtyla
          often played on the Jewish side. "I remember that at least a third of my
          classmates at elementary school <br />in Wadowice were Jews. At
          elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very friendly
          terms. And what <br />struck me about some of them was their Polish
          patriotism."
        </p>
        <h2>Priesthood</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing his studies at the seminary in Krakow, Wojtyla was
          ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day,
          <br />1 November 1946, by the Archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Adam Stefan
          Sapieha. Sapieha sent Wojtyla to Rome's <br />Pontifical International
          Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas
          Aquinas, to <br />study under the French Dominican friar Reginald
          Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946. He resided <br />in the
          Belgian Pontifical College during this time, under rectorship of
          Maximilien de Furstenberg. Wojtyla <br />earned a licence in July 1947,
          passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended his
          doctoral <br />thesis titled Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce
          (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross) in <br />philosophy on
          19 June 1948. The Angelicum preserves the original copy of Wojtyla's
          typewritten thesis. Among <br />other courses at the Angelicum, Wojtyla
          studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G. Duncker, author of
          <br />the <em>Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Pastoral Journeys</h2>
        <p>
          During his pontificate, John Paul II made journeys to 129 countries,
          travelling more than 1,100,000
          <br />kilometres (680,000 mi) while doing so. He consistently attracted
          large crowds, some among the largest <br />ever assembled in human
          history, such as the Manila World Youth Day, which gathered up to four
          million <br />people, the largest papal gathering ever, according to the
          Vatican. John Paul II's earliest official <br />visits were to the
          Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979. While some of his
          journeys (such as <br />to the United States and the Holy Land) were to
          places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul <br />II became the
          first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was
          greeted warmly by <br />then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first
          pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting <br />in 1979
          with Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope to travel to the
          United Kingdom, in 1982, <br />where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the
          Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain he also
          <br />visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert
          Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the <br />spot where Thomas a
          Becket had been killed, as well as holding several large-scale open air
          masses, including <br />one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by
          some 80,000 people.
        </p>
        <h2>Assassination attempts and plots</h2>
        <p>
          As he entered St. Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May 1981,
          John Paul II was shot and
          <br />critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Agca, an expert Turkish gunman
          who was a member of the militant <br />fascist group Grey Wolves. The
          assassin used a Browning 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the
          <br />pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine
          multiple times John Paul II was <br />rushed into the Vatican complex
          and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he
          <br />lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his
          mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, <br />he lost nearly
          three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat
          his wounds. <br />Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting
          the upper part of the large intestine to let <br />the damaged lower
          part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated
          on, he <br />instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular
          during the operation. One of the few people <br />allowed in to see him
          at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher
          Anna-Teresa <br />Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept
          him company while he recovered from emergency <br />surgery. The pope
          later stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary helped keep him alive
          throughout his <br />ordeal.
        </p>
        <h2>Death and funeral</h2>
        <p>
          John Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout
          of influenza on 1 February
          <br />2005. He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently
          hospitalised again with breathing <br />problems two weeks later and
          underwent a tracheotomy. On 31 March 2005, following a urinary tract
          <br />infection, he developed septic shock, a form of infection with a
          high fever and low blood pressure, <br />but was not hospitalised.
          Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants at his private
          residence. <br />This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those
          close to him, that he was nearing death; it <br />would have been in
          accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day,
          Vatican sources <br />announced that John Paul II had been given the
          Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary <br />Stanislaw
          Dziwisz. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated:
          "I have searched for <br />you, and now you have come to me, and I thank
          you." On Saturday, 2 April 2005, at approximately 15:30 <br />CEST, John
          Paul II spoke his final words in Polish,
          <em>"Pozwolcie mi odejsc do domu Ojca"</em> ("Allow me to <br />depart
          to the house of the Father"), to his aides, and fell into a coma about
          four hours later.
