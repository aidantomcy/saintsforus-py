          St. Joseph (100 BCE-1 AD) is a figure in the Canonical Gospels who was
          married to Mary, Jesus' mother,
          <br />and was Jesus' legal father. The Gospels name brothers of Jesus,
          but the Gospel of James, an apocryphal <br />work of the late 2nd
          century, explained that they were the sons of Joseph from an earlier
          marriage. This <br />position is still held in Orthodox Churches, but in
          the Western Church it was dropped in favour of St. <br />Jerome's
          argument that Joseph, like Mary, must have been a lifelong virgin and
          that the "brothers" must <br />have been his cousins. Perspectives on
          Joseph as a historical figure are distinguished from a theological
          <br />reading of the Gospel texts.
        </p>
        <h2>In the New Testament</h2>
        <p>
          The epistles of Paul are the oldest extant Christian writings. These
          mention Jesus' mother (without
          <br />naming her), but do not refer to his father. The Gospel of Mark,
          believed to be the first gospel to <br />be written and with a date
          about two decades after Paul, also does not mention Jesus' father. The
          <br />first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke,
          often dated from around 80-90 AD. <br />Each contains a genealogy of
          Jesus showing ancestry from King David, but through different sons;
          Matthew <br />follows the major royal line from Solomon, while Luke
          traces another line back to Nathan, another son <br />of David and
          Bathsheba. Consequently, all the names between David and Joseph are
          different. Like the <br />two differing genealogies, the infancy
          narratives appear only in Matthew and Luke and take different
          <br />approaches to reconciling the requirement that the Messiah be born
          in Bethlehem with the tradition that <br />Jesus in fact came from
          Nazareth.
        </p>
        <h2>Birth of Jesus</h2>
        <p>
          According to the author of the gospel according to Luke, a decree of the
          Roman Emperor Augustus required
          <br />that Joseph return to his hometown of Bethlehem to register for a
          Roman census; see Census of Quirinius. <br />While he was there with
          Mary, she gave birth to Jesus; but because there was no place for them
          in the inn, <br />she used a manger as a cradle. After eight days, he
          was circumcised according to Jewish law and named "Jesus
          <br />(Yeshu'a), which means "Yahweh is salvation". After Mary continued
          in the "blood of her purifying" another <br />33 days, for a total of 40
          days, she brought her burnt offering and sin offering to the Temple in
          Jerusalem <br />[Luke 2:22] so the priest could make atonement for
          her.[Leviticus 12:1-8] They also presented Jesus - "As it <br />is
          written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall
          be called holy to the Lord" (Luke <br />2:23 other verses). After the
          prophecies of Simeon and the prophetess Anna in Luke 2:25-38, the family
          "returned <br />into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth".
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament has no mention of Joseph's death, but he is never
          mentioned after Jesus's childhood,
          <br />and Mary is always presented as by herself, often dressed as a
          widow, in other texts and art covering <br />the period of the ministry
          and passion of Jesus. By contrast, the apocryphal History of Joseph the
          <br />Carpenter, from the 5th or 6th century, has a long account of
          Joseph's peaceful death, at the age of <br />111, in the presence of
          Jesus (aged about 19), Mary and angels. This scene starts to appear in
          art in <br />the 17th century.
        </p>
        <h2>Later apocryphal writings</h2>
        <p>
          The canonical gospels created a problem: they stated clearly that Mary
          was a virgin when she conceived
          <br />Jesus, and that Joseph was not his father; yet Joseph's paternity
          was essential to establish Jesus' <br />Davidic descent. The theological
          situation was complicated by the gospel references to Jesus' "brothers
          <br />and sisters" (repeated in Paul, where James is called the "brother
          of the Lord"), and by the fact that <br />Jesus was described
          unambiguously by John and Matthew as "Joseph's son" and "the carpenter's
          son". From <br />the 2nd century to the 5th writers tried to explain how
          Jesus could be simultaneously the "son of God" <br />and the "son of
          Joseph".
