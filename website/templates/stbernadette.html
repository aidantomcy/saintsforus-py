          St. Bernadette (7 January 1844-16 April 1879) was the firstborn daughter
          of a miller from Lourdes in the
          <br />department of Hautes-Pyrenees in France. She is best known for
          experiencing Marian Apparitions of a "young lady" <br />who asked for a
          Chapel to be built at the nearby cave-grotto at Massabielle. These
          apparitions are said to have <br />occured between 11 February and 16
          July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the
          <br />"Immaculate Conception." After a canonical investigation,
          Bernadette's reports were eventually declared "worthy of <br />belief"
          on 18 February 1862, and the Marian Apparition became known as Our Lady
          of Lourdes. Since her death, her <br />body has apparently remained
          internally incorrupt. On 8 December 1933, Pope Pius XI declared
          Bernadette a saint.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Stages of Her Life</h2>
        <p>
          Marie Bernarde Soubirous was the daughter of Francois Soubirous
          (1807-1871), a miller, and Louise
          <br />(nee Casterot; 1825-1866), a laundress. Soubirous was born on 7
          January 1844 and baptized at the <br />local parish church, St.
          Pierre's, on 9 January, her parents' wedding anniversary. Her godmother
          <br />was Bernarde Casterot, her mother's sister, a moderately wealthy
          widow who owned a tavern. Hard <br />times had fallen on France and the
          family lived in extreme poverty. She contracted cholera as a
          <br />toddler and suffered severe asthma for the rest of her life.
          Soubirous attended the day school <br />conducted by the Sisters of
          Charity and Christian Instruction from Nevers. Contrary to a belief
          <br />popularized by Hollywood films, Soubirous learned very little
          French, only studying French in <br />school after age 13. At that time
          she could read and write very little due to her frequent illness.
        </p>

        <h2>Visions</h2>
        <p>
          On 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering firewood
          with her sister Toinette and a friend
          <br />near the grotto of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she
          experienced her first vision. While the other <br />girls crossed the
          little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed
          behind, looking for a <br />place to cross where she wouldn't get her
          stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order
          <br />to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard
          the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. <br />A wild rose in a
          natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or
          rather the dark alcove <br />behind it, "came a dazzling light, and a
          white figure". This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred
          <br />to as aquero , Gascon Occitan for "that". In later testimony, she
          called it "a small young lady" (uo petito <br />damizelo). Her sister
          and her friend stated that they had seen nothing. On 14 February, after
          Sunday Mass, <br />Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other
          girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately
          <br />saying she saw the apparition again. When one of the girls threw
          holy water at the niche and another threw a <br />rock from above that
          shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared. On her next visit,
          18 February, <br />Soubirous said that "the vision" asked her to return
          to the grotto every day for a fortnight.
        </p>
        <h2>Later Years and Death</h2>
        <p>
          On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit
          of a postulant and joined the
          <br />Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at Nevers. The Mother
          Superior at the time gave her the name <br />Marie-Bernarde in honor of
          her godmother who was named "Bernarde". As Patricia A. McEachern
          observes, <br />"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron
          saint; she copied long texts related to him in <br />notebooks and on
          bits of paper. Unfortunately, Soubirous's childhood bout of "cholera
          left...[Bernadette] <br />with severe, chronic asthma, and eventually
          she contracted tuberculosis of the lungs and bones." <br />For several
          months prior to her death, she was unable to take an active part in
          convent life. She eventually <br />died of her long-term illness at the
          age of 35 on 16 April 1879 (the Wednesday after Easter), while praying
          <br />the holy rosary. On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain
          and in keeping with the Virgin Mary's <br />admonition of "Penance,
          Penance, Penance," Bernadette proclaimed that "all this is good for
          Heaven!" Her <br />final words were, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
          me, a poor sinner, a poor sinner".
        </p>
        <h2>Reorganization of the Franciscan Order</h2>
        <p>
          The growing order of friars was divided into provinces; groups were sent
          to France, Germany, Hungary, and
          <br />Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of
          five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned <br />to Italy via Venice.
          Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by the pope as the
          protector of the order. <br />Another reason for Francis' return to
          Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate
          <br />compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational
          sophistication had not kept up with this growth <br />and had little
          more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this
          problem, Francis prepared <br />a new and more detailed Rule, the "First
          Rule" or "Rule Without a Papal Bull" (Regula prima, Regula non bullata),
          <br />which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life.
          However, it also introduced greater institutional <br />structure,
          though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.
