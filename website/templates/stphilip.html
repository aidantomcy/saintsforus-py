          St. Philip was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New
          Testament. Later Christian
          <br />traditions describe Philip as the Apostle who preached in Greece,
          Syria and Phrygia. In the Roman <br />Rite, the feast day of Philip,
          along with that of James the Less, was traditionally observed on 1
          <br />May, the anniversary of the dedication of the Church to Rome.
          However, the Eastern Orthodox Church <br />celebrates Philip's feast on
          14 November. One of the Gnostic codices discovered in the Nag Hammadi
          <br />library in 1945 bears Philip's name in its title, on the bottom
          line. The Synoptic Gospels list Philip <br />as one of the apostles. The
          Gospel of John recounts Philip's calling as a disciple of Jesus. He is
          <br />described as a disciple from the city of Bethsaida, and the
          evangelist connects him with Andrew and <br />Peter, who were from the
          same town. He was also among those surrounding John the Baptist when the
          latter <br />first pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God.

        <h2>New Testament</h2>
        <p>
          The Synoptic Gospels list Philip as one of the apostles. The Gospel of
          John recounts Philip's calling
          <br />as a disciple of Jesus.[Jn 1:43] Philip is described as a disciple
          from the city of Bethsaida, and <br />the evangelist connects him with
          Andrew and Peter, who were from the same town. He also was among those
          <br />surrounding John the Baptist when the latter first pointed out
          Jesus as the Lamb of God. It was Philip <br />who first introduced
          Nathanael (sometimes identified with Bartholomew) to Jesus. According to
          Butler, <br />Philip was among those attending the wedding at Cana. Of
          the four Gospels, Philip figures most prominently <br />in the Gospel of
          John.

        <h2>Christian tradition</h2>
        <p>
          Accounts of Philip's life and ministry exist in the extra-canonical
          writings of later Christians. However,
          <br />some can be misleading, as many hagiographers conflated Philip the
          Apostle with Philip the Evangelist. The <br />most notable and
          influential example of this is the hagiography of Eusebius, in which
          Eusebius clearly <br />assumes that both Philips are the same person. As
          early as 1260, Jacobus de Voragine noted in his Golden <br />Legend that
          the account of Philip's life given by Eusebius was not to be trusted. An
          early extra-biblical <br />story about St. Philip is preserved in the
          apocryphal Letter from Peter to Philip, one of the texts in the
          <br />Nag Hammadi Library, and dated to the end of the 2nd century or
          early 3rd. This text begins with a letter from <br />St Peter to Philip
          the apostle, asking him to rejoin the other apostles who had gathered at
          the Mount of Olives. <br />Fred Lapham believes that this letter
          indicates an early tradition that "at some point between the
          Resurrection <br />of Jesus and the final parting of his risen presence
          from the disciples, Philip had undertaken a sole missionary
          <br />enterprise, and was, for some reason, reluctant to return to the
          rest of the Apostles." This mission is in harmony <br />with the later
          tradition that each disciple was given a specific missionary charge.
          Lapham explains the central <br />section, a Gnostic dialogue between
          the risen Christ and his disciples, as a later insertion

        <h2>Relics and Veneration</h2>
        <p>
          Included in the Acts of Philip is an appendix, entitled "Of the Journey
          of Philip the Apostle: From the
          <br />Fifteenth Act Until the End, and Among Them the Martyrdom." This
          appendix gives an account of Philip's <br />martyrdom in the city of
          Hierapolis. According to this account, through a miraculous healing and
          his <br />preaching Philip converted the wife of the proconsul of the
          city. This enraged the proconsul, and he had <br />Philip, Bartholomew,
          and Mariamne all tortured. Philip and Bartholomew were then crucified
          upside-down, <br />and Philip preached from his cross. As a result of
          Philip's preaching the crowd released Bartholomew from <br />his cross,
          but Philip insisted that they not release him, and Philip died on the
          cross. Another legend is <br />that he was martyred by beheading in the
          city of Hierapolis. Nowadays relics of Philip the Apostle are in
          <br />the crypt of Basilica Santi Apostoli, Rome. Philip is commonly
          associated with the symbol of the Latin cross. <br />Other symbols
          assigned to Philip include: the cross with the two loaves (because of
          his answer to the Lord <br />in John 6:7), a basket filled with bread, a
          spear with the patriarchal cross, and a cross with a carpenter's
          <br />square. Philip is remembered (with James) in the Church of England
          with a Festival on 1 May.
