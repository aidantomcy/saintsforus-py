          <br />St. Peter (AD 1-AD 68), also known as Simon Peter, was one of the
          Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ <br />and one of the first leaders of
          the Early Church. According to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified
          <br />in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is traditionally counted as the
          first Bishop of Rome or Pope and also <br />as the first Patriarch of
          Antioch by the Eastern Christian tradition. The ancient Christian
          churches all venerate <br />Peter as a major saint and as the founder of
          the Church of Antioch and the Diocese of Rome, but differ in <br />their
          attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to
          Catholic teaching, in Matthew 16:18, <br />Jesus promised Peter a
          special position in the church.
        </p>
        <h2>Names and Etymologies</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents Peter's original name as Simon. In only two
          passages, his name is instead spelled
          <br />"Simeon". The variation possibly reflects "the well-known custom
          among Jews at the time of giving the name of <br />a famous patriarch or
          personage of the Old Testament to a male child [i.e., Simeon] along with
          a similar sounding <br />Greek/Roman name [in this case, Simon]". He was
          later given by Jesus the name Cephas, from Aramaic (Kepha), literally
          <br />meaning "rock" or "stone". In translations of the Bible from the
          original Greek, his name is maintained as Cephas <br />n 9 occurrences
          in the New Testament, whereas in the vast majority of mentions (156
          occurrences in the New Testament) <br />he is called (Petros), from the
          Greek and Latin word for a rock or stone (petra) to which the masculine
          ending was <br />added, rendered into English as Peter.
        </p>
        <h2>First leader of the early Church</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospels and Acts portray Peter as the most prominent apostle, though
          he denied Jesus three times during
          <br />the events of the crucifixion. According to the Christian
          tradition, Peter was the first disciple to whom <br />Jesus appeared,
          balancing Peter's denial and restoring his position. Peter is regarded
          as the first leader <br />of the early Church, though he was soon
          eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, "the Brother of the
          <br />Lord". Because Peter was the first to whom Jesus appeared, the
          leadership of Peter forms the basis of the <br />Apostolic succession
          and the institutional power of orthodoxy, as the heirs of Peter, and he
          is described <br />as "the rock" on which the church will be built.
          Peter is always listed first among the Twelve Apostles in <br />the
          gospels and in the Book of Acts. He is also frequently mentioned in the
          gospels as forming with James the <br />Elder and John a special group
          within the Twelve Apostles, present at incidents at which the others
          were not <br />present, such as at the Transfiguration of Jesus, at the
          raising of Jairus' daughter and at the agony in the <br />Garden of
          Gethsemane. Peter often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah.
        </p>
        <h2>Connection to Rome</h2>
        <p>
          In a tradition of the early Church, Peter is said to have founded the
          Church in Rome with Paul, served as
          <br />its bishop, authored two epistles, and then met martyrdom there
          along with Paul. The Catholic Church speaks <br />of the pope, the
          bishop of Rome, as the successor of Saint Peter. This is often
          interpreted to imply that <br />Peter was the first Bishop of Rome.
          However, it is also said that the institution of the papacy is not
          <br />dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his
          ever having been in Rome. St. Clement of <br />Rome identifies Peter and
          Paul as the outstanding heroes of the faith.There is no obvious biblical
          evidence <br />that Peter was ever in Rome, but the first epistle of
          Peter does mention that "The church that is at Babylon, <br />elected
          together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son."
        </p>
        <h2>Death and Burial</h2>
        <p>
          In the epilogue of the Gospel of John, Jesus hints at the death by which
          Peter would glorify God, saying: "when
          <br />you are old you will stretch out your hands, and another will
          dress you and carry you where you do not want to <br />go." This is
          interpreted by some as a reference to Peter's crucifixion. Theologians
          Donald Fay Robinson and Warren <br />M. Smaltz have suggested that the
          incident in Acts 12:1-17, where Peter is "released by an angel" and goes
          to "another <br />place", really represents an idealized account of his
          death, which may have occurred in a Jerusalem prison as early <br />as
          AD 44.Early Church tradition says that Peter probably died by
          crucifixion (with arms outstretched) at the time <br />of the Great Fire
          of Rome in the year 64. This took place three months after the
          disastrous fire that destroyed <br />Rome for which the emperor (Nero)
          wished to blame the Christians. In the early 4th century, the Emperor
          Constantine <br />decided to honour Peter with a large
          basilica.[100][101] Because the precise location of Peter's burial was
          so firmly <br />fixed in the belief of the Christians of Rome, the
          church to house the basilica had to be erected on a site that was
          <br />not convenient to construction.
        </p>
        <h2>Catholic Church</h2>
        <p>
          According to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to
          hold the first place of honor and
          <br />authority. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop
          of Rome, the first Pope. Furthermore, <br />they consider every Pope to
          be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other bishops.
          However, <br />Peter never bore the title of "Pope" or "Vicar of Christ"
          in the sense the Catholic Church considers Peter <br />the first Pope.
          The Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on
          earth (with Christ being <br />its heavenly head) is based on its
          interpretation of two passages from the canonical gospels of the New
          <br />Testament, as well as sacred tradition.
