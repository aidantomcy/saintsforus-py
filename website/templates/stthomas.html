          St. Thomas (1st century AD-21 December AD 72) was one of the Twelve
          Apostles of Jesus according to the
          <br />New Testament. Thomas is commonly known as "Doubting Thomas"
          because he doubted Jesus' ressurection when <br />first told of it.
          Later, he confessed his faith, "My Lord and my God," on seeing Jesus'
          crucifixion wounds. <br />According to traditional accounts of the Saint
          Thomas Christians of modern-day Kerala in India, Thomas is
          <br />believed to have travelled outside the Roman Empire to preach the
          Gospel, going as far as the Malabar Coast <br />which is in modern-day
          Kerala. According to their tradition, Thomas reached Muziris (modern-day
          North-Paravur <br />and and Kodungalloor in Kerala) in AD 52. In 1258,
          some of the relics were brought to Ortona, in Abbruzo, <br />Italy,
          where they have been held in the Church of Saint Thomas the Apostle. He
          is often regarded as the patron <br />saint of India.
        </p>
        <h2>Gospel of John</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas first speaks in the Gospel of John. In John 11:16, when Lazarus
          has recently died, and the
          <br />apostles do not wish to go back to Judea, Thomas says: "Let us
          also go, that we may die with him." <br />Thomas speaks again in John
          14:5. There, Jesus had just explained that he was going away to prepare
          <br />a heavenly home for his followers, and that one day they would
          join him there. Thomas reacted by saying, <br />"Lord, we know not thou
          goest; and how can we know the way?" John 20:24-29 tells how doubting
          Thomas was <br />skeptical at first when he heard that Jesus had risen
          from the dead and appeared to the other apostles, <br />saying, "Except
          I shall see on his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into
          the print of <br />the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will
          not believe." But when Jesus appeared later and <br />invited Thomas to
          touch his wounds and behold him, Thomas showed his belief by saying, "My
          Lord and my <br />God". Jesus then said, "Thomas, because thou hast seen
          me, thou hast believed: blessed <em>[are]</em> they <br />that have not
          seen, and <em>[yet]</em> have believed."
        </p>
        <h2>Feast days</h2>
        <p>
          When the feast of Saint Thomas was inserted in the Roman calendar in the
          9th century, it was assigned to
          <br />21 December. The Martyrology of St. Jerome mentioned the apostle
          on 3 July, the date to which the Roman <br />celebration was transferred
          in 1969, so that it would no longer interfere with the major ferial days
          of <br />Advent. Traditionalist Roman Catholics (who follow the General
          Roman Calendar of 1960 or earlier) and many <br />Anglicans (including
          members of the Episcopal Church as well as members of the Church of
          England and the <br />Lutheran Church, who worship according to the 1662
          edition of the Book of Common Prayer), still celebrate <br />his feast
          day on 21 December. However, most modern liturgical calendars (including
          the Common Worship <br />calendar of the Church of England) prefer 3
          July, Thomas is remembered in the Church of England with a
          <br />Festival.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission in India</h2>
        <p>
          According to traditional accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians of
          India, the Apostle Thomas landed
          <br />in Muziris (Cranganore) on the Kerala coast in AD 52 and was
          martyred in Mylapore, near Madras in AD 72. <br />The port was destroyed
          in 1341 by a massive flood that realigned the coasts. He is believed by
          the Saint <br />Thomas Christian tradition to have established seven
          churches (communities) in Kerala. These churches are <br />at
          Kodungallur, Palayoor, Kottakkavu (Paravur), Kokkamangalam, Niranam,
          Nilackal (Chayal), Kollam, and <br />Thiruvithamcode. Thomas baptized
          several families, namely Pakalomattom, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kaliyankal
          etc. <br />Other families claim to have origins almost as far back as
          these, and the religious historian Robert Eric <br />Frykenberg notes
          that: "Whatever dubious historicity may be attached to such local
          traditions, there can be <br />little doubt as to their great antiquity
          or to their great appeal in the popular imagination."
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          According to Syrian Christian tradition, Thomas was killed at St. Thomas
          Mount in Chennai on 3 July in
          <br />AD 72, he was castrated, and his body was interred in Mylapore.
          Ephrem the Syrian states that the Apostle <br />was killed in India, and
          that his relics were taken then to Edessa. This is the earliest known
          record of <br />his death. The records of Barbosa from the early 16th
          century record that the tomb was then maintained by <br />a Muslim who
          kept a lamp burning there. The San Thome Basilica Mylapore, Chennai,
          Tamil Nadu, India presently <br />located at the tomb was first built in
          the 16th century by the Portuguese and rebuilt in the 19th century.
          <br />St. Thomas Mount has been a revered site by Muslims and Christians
          since at least the 16th century.
