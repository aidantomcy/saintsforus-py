          St. George (3rd century AD-23 April 303) was a Christian of Cappadocian
          Greek origins, who is accepted
          <br />as a saint in Christianity. According to traditional rumours, he
          was a soldier in the Roman Army. His <br />parents were Christians of
          Greek origin. His father, Gerontius, was a Cappadocian serving in the
          Roman <br />Army. His mother, Polychronia, was a Christian from the city
          of Lod in Palestine. St. George was a soldier, <br />a member of the
          Praetorian Guard for Roman Emperor Diocletian, who was sentenced to
          death for refusing to <br />recant his Christian faith. He became one of
          the most venerated saints and megalomartyrs in Christianity, <br />and
          he has been seen especially as a military saint since the Crusades. In
          hagiography, as one of the Fourteen <br />Holy Helpers and one of the
          most prominent military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of St.
          George <br />and the Dragon. England, Ethiopa, Georgia, Catalonia and
          Aragon in Spain and several other nations, states, <br />cities,
          universities, professions and organizations all claim St. George as
          their patron saint.

        <h2>Legend</h2>
        <p>
          Very little is known about George's life, but it is thought he was a
          Roman officer of Greek descent
          <br />from Cappadocia who was martyred in one of the pre-Constantinian
          persecutions. Beyond this, early <br />sources give conflicting
          information. There are two main versions of the legend, a Greek and a
          Latin <br />version, which can both be traced to the 5th or 6th century.
          The saint's veneration dates to the 5th <br />century with some
          certainty, and possibly still to the 4th. The addition of the dragon
          legend dates <br />to the 11th century. The earliest text which
          preserves fragments of George's narrative is in a Greek
          <br />hagiography which is identified by Hippolyte Delehaye of the
          scholarly Bollandists to be a palimpsest <br />of the 5th century. An
          earlier work by Eusebius, Church history, written in the 4th century,
          contributed <br />to the legend but did not name George or provide
          significant detail. The work of the Bollandists Daniel <br />Papebroch,
          Jean Bolland, and Godfrey Henschen in the 17th century was one of the
          first pieces of scholarly <br />research to establish the saint's
          historicity, via their publications in
          <em>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca</em>.

        <h2>George and the dragon</h2>
        <p>
          The legend of Saint George and the Dragon was first recorded in the 11th
          century, in a Georgian source.
          <br />It reached Catholic Europe in the 12th century. In the Golden
          Legend, by 13th-century Archbishop of <br />Genoa Jacobus da Varagine,
          George's death was at the hands of Dacian, and about the year 287. Saint
          <br />George Killing the Dragon, 1434/35, by Bernat Martorell The
          tradition tells that a fierce dragon was <br />causing panic at the city
          of Silene, Libya, at the time George arrived there. In order to prevent
          the <br />dragon from devastating people from the city, they gave two
          sheep each day to the dragon, but when the <br />sheep were not enough
          they were forced to sacrifice humans instead of the two sheep. The human
          to be <br />sacrificed was elected by the city's own people and one time
          the king's daughter was chosen to be sacrificed <br />but no one was
          willing to take her place. George saved the girl by slaying the dragon
          with a lance. The king <br />was so grateful that he offered him
          treasures as a reward for saving his daughter's life, but George refused
          <br />it and instead he gave these to the poor. The people of the city
          were so amazed at what they had witnessed <br />that they became
          Christians and were all baptized.
        </p>
        <h2>Veneration</h2>
        <p>
          A titular church built in Lydda during the reign of Constantine the
          Great (reigned 306-337) was consecrated
          <br />to "a man of the highest distinction", according to the church
          history of Eusebius; the name of the titulus <br />"patron" was not
          disclosed, but later he was asserted[by whom?] to have been George. The
          veneration of George <br />spread from Syria Palaestina through Lebanon
          to the rest of the Byzantine Empire - though the martyr is not
          <br />mentioned in the Syriac Breviarium - and the region east of the
          Black Sea. By the 5th century, the veneration <br />of George had
          reached the Christian Western Roman Empire, as well: in 494, George was
          canonized as a saint by <br />Pope Gelasius I, among those "whose names
          are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to
          <br />[God]."
        </p>
        <h2>Iconography</h2>
        <p>
          George is most commonly depicted in early icons, mosaics, and frescos
          wearing armour contemporary with
          <br />the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to
          identify him as a Roman soldier. <br />Particularly after the Fall of
          Constantinople and George's association with the crusades, he is often
          <br />portrayed mounted upon a white horse. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp
          (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's <br />death) depicts an
          armoured George atop a white horse, killing the dragon. George may also
          be portrayed with <br />Saint Demetrius, another early soldier saint.
          When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon
          <br />horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels
          Michael and Gabriel. Eastern traditions <br />distinguish the two as
          George rides a white horse and Demetrius a red horse (the red pigment
          may appear black <br />if it has bituminized). George can also be
          identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Demetrius may be
          <br />spearing a human figure, representing Maximian.
