          St. Therese of Lisieux (2 January 1873-30 September 1897) was a French
          Catholic Discalced Carmelite nun
          <br />who is widely venerated in modern times. She is popularly known as
          "The Little Flower of Jesus," or simply <br />"The Little Flower."
          Therese has been a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics
          and for others <br />because of the simplicity and practicality of her
          approach to the spiritual life. Together with Francis of <br />Assisi,
          she is one of the most popular saints in the history of the Church. Pope
          Pius X called her "the <br />greatest saint of modern times." Therese
          felt an early call to religious life and after overcoming various
          <br />obstacles in 1888, at the early age of 15, she became a nun and
          joined two of her older sisters in the <br />cloistered Carmelite
          community of Lisieux, Normandy. After nine years as a Carmelite
          religious, having <br />fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and
          assistant to the novice mistress, and having spent her last <br />18
          months in Carmel in a night of faith, she died at the age of 24 from
          tuberculosis.
        </p>
        <h2>Family Background</h2>
        <p>
          Therese was born on Rue Saint-Blaise, in Alencon, France on January 2,
          1873, and was the daughter of
          <br />Marie-Azelie Guerin (usually called Zelie), and Louis Martin who
          was a jeweler and watchmaker. Both her <br />parents were devout
          Catholics who would eventually become the first (and to date only)
          married couple <br />canonized together by the Roman Catholic Church (by
          Pope Francis in 2015). Louis had tried to become a <br />canon regular,
          wanting to enter the Great St Bernard Hospice, but had been refused
          because he didn't know <br />Latin. Zelie, possessed of a strong, active
          temperament, wished to serve the sick, and had also considered
          <br />entering consecrated life, but the prioress of the canonesses
          regular of the Hotel-Dieu in Alencon had <br />discouraged her outright.
          Disappointed, Zelie learned lacemaking instead. She excelled in it and
          set up <br />her own business on Rue Saint-Blaise at age 22.
        </p>
        <h2>Birth and infancy</h2>
        <p>
          Soon after her birth in January 1873, the outlook for the survival of
          Therese Martin was uncertain.
          <br />Because of her frail condition, she was entrusted to a wet nurse,
          Rose Taille, who had already nursed <br />two of the Martin children.
          Rose had her own children and could not live with the Martins, so
          Therese <br />was sent to live with her in the forests of the Bocage the
          Semalle. On 2 April 1874, when she was 15 <br />months old, she returned
          to Alencon where her family surrounded her with affection. "I hear the
          baby <br />calling me Mama! as she goes down the stairs. On every step,
          she calls out Mama! and if I don't respond <br />every time, she remains
          there without going either forward or back." (Madame Martin to Pauline,
          21 November <br />1875) She was educated in a very Catholic environment,
          including Mass attendance at 5:30 a.m., the strict <br />observance of
          fasts, and prayer to the rhythm of the liturgical year. The Martins also
          practiced charity, <br />visiting the sick and elderly and welcoming the
          occasional vagabond to their table. Even if she was not <br />the model
          little girl, her sisters later portrayed, Therese was very responsive to
          this education.
        </p>
        <h2>Early years</h2>
        <p>
          Therese was taught at home until she was eight and a half, and then
          entered the school kept by the
          <br />Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux.
          Therese, taught well and carefully by <br />Marie and Pauline, found
          herself at the top of the class, except for writing and arithmetic.
          However, <br />because of her young age and high grades, she was
          bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl <br />of fourteen
          who did poorly at school. Therese suffered very much as a result of her
          sensitivity, and <br />she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous
          games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred <br />to tell
          stories or look after the little ones in the infants class.
        </p>
        <h2>Illness</h2>
        <p>
          At this time, Therese was often sick. She began to suffer from nervous
          tremors. The tremors started one
          <br />night after her uncle took her for a walk and began to talk about
          Zelie. Assuming that she was cold, the <br />family covered Therese with
          blankets, but the tremors continued. She clenched her teeth and could
          not speak. <br />The family called Dr. Notta, who could make no
          diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral diagnosed that Therese "reacts <br />to
          an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack". Alarmed, but
          cloistered, Pauline began to write letters <br />to Therese and
          attempted various strategies to intervene. Eventually Therese recovered
          after she had turned <br />to gaze at the statue of the Virgin Mary
          placed in Marie's room, where Therese had been moved. She reported
          <br />on 13 May 1883 that she had seen the Virgin smile at her. She
          wrote: "Our Blessed Lady has come to me, she <br />has smiled upon me.
          How happy I am."
        </p>
        <h2>Rome and entry to Carmel</h2>
        <p>
          In May 1887, Therese approached her 63-year-old father Louis, who was
          recovering from a small stroke,
          <br />while he sat in the garden one Sunday afternoon and told him that
          she wanted to celebrate the anniversary <br />of "her conversion" by
          entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Thérèse both broke down and
          cried, but <br />Louis got up, gently picked a little white flower, root
          intact, and gave it to her, explaining the care <br />with which God
          brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Thérèse later
          wrote: "while I listened <br />I believed I was hearing my own story".
          To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, "destined to live
          <br />in another soil". Therese renewed her attempts to join the Carmel,
          but the priest-superior of the monastery <br />would not allow it on
          account of her youth.
        </p>
        <h2>Final years</h2>
        <p>
          Therese's final years were marked by a steady decline that she bore
          resolutely and without complaint.
          <br />Tuberculosis was the key element of Therese's final suffering, but
          she saw that as part of her spiritual <br />journey. After observing a
          rigorous Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday
          and <br />felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: "Oh! how sweet this memory
          really is! … I had scarcely laid my head <br />upon the pillow when I
          felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know
          what it <br />was." The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in
          blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of <br />blood meant
          tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, "I thought
          immediately of the joyful <br />thing that I had to learn, so I went
          over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah!
          <br />my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly
          persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary <br />of His own death, wanted
          to have me hear His first call!"
