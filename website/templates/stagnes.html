          <br />St. Agnes (291-304) was a virgin martyr, venerated as a saint in
          the Roman Catholic Church, <br />Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican
          Communion and Lutheranism. St. Agnes is one of several virgin
          <br />martyrs commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass. She is
          depicted in art with a lamb, <br />evoking her name, which resembles the
          latin word for lamb, "Agnus." She is also shown with a <br />martyr's
          palm. St. Agnes is the patron saint of girls and chastity.

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Substantially the circumstances of her martyrdom are believed to be
          authentic, though the legend cannot
          <br />be proven true, and many details of the fifth century Acts of
          Saint Agnes are open to criticism. A church <br />was built over her
          tomb, and her relics venerated. According to tradition, Agnes was a
          member of the Roman <br />nobility, born in AD 291 and raised in an
          early Christian family. She suffered martyrdom at the age of
          <br />twelve or thirteen during the reign of the Roman emperor
          Diocletian, on 21 January 304. A beautiful young <br />girl from a
          wealthy family, Agnes had many suitors of high rank, and the young men,
          slighted by her resolute <br />devotion to religious purity, submitted
          her name to the authorities as a follower of Christianity. She was
          <br />led out and bound to a stake, but the bundle of wood would not
          burn, or the flames parted away from her, <br />whereupon the officer in
          charge of the troops drew his sword and beheaded her, or, in some other
          texts, <br />stabbed her in the throat. It is also said that her blood
          poured to the stadium floor where other Christians <br />soaked it up
          with cloths.

        <h2>Veneration</h2>
        <p>
          Agnes was venerated as a saint at least as early as the time of St
          Ambrose, based on an existing homily.
          <br />She is commemorated in the Depositio Martyrum of Filocalus (354)
          and in the early Roman Sacramentaries. <br />Saint Agnes' bones are
          conserved beneath the high altar in the church of Sant'Agnese fuori le
          mura in <br />Rome, built over the catacomb that housed her tomb. Her
          skull is preserved in a separate chapel in <br />the church of
          Sant'Agnese in Agone in Rome's Piazza Navona. Because of the legend
          around her martyrdom, <br />Saint Agnes is patron saint of those seeking
          chastity and purity. Since the Middle Ages, Saint Agnes has
          <br />traditionally been depicted as a young girl with her long hair
          down, with a lamb, the symbol of both her <br />virginal innocence and
          her name, and a sword (together with the palm branch an attribute of her
          martyrdom). <br />The lamb, which is agnus in the Latin language, is
          also the linguistic link to the traditional blessing <br />of lambs
          referred to below.
