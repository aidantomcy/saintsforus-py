          St. Sebastian (AD 256-AD 288) was an early Christian saint and martyr.
          According to traditional belief,
          <br />he was killed during the Roman Emperor Diocletian's persecution of
          Christians. He was initially tied to <br />a post or tree and shot with
          arrows, though this did not kill him. He was, according to tradition,
          rescued <br />and healed by St. Irene of Rome, which became a popular
          subject in 17th-century painting. In all versions <br />of the story,
          shortly after his recovery, he went to Diocletian to warn him about his
          sins, and, as a result, <br />Sebastian was clubbed to death. He is
          venerated in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. The
          <br />oldest record of the details of Sebastian's martyrdom is a sermon
          on Psalm 118 by 4th-century Bishop Ambrose <br />of Milan (St. Ambrose).
          In his sermon, Ambrose stated that Sebastian came from Milan and that he
          was already <br />venerated there at that time. He is the patron saint
          of athletes.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          The ancient source mentioning Sebastian is found in the Chronograph of
          354, a compilation of chronological
          <br />and calendrical texts produced in 354 AD by the calligrapher and
          illustrator Furius Dionysius Filocalus, <br />which mentions him as a
          martyr who was venerated on January 20. His cult is also mentioned by
          Ambrose of <br />Milan in his Expositio in Psalmum CXVIII, a theological
          and exegetical commentary of Psalm 118 dated to <br />386-390 AD. The
          first surviving account of Sebastian's life and death is the Passio
          Sancti Sebastiani, <br />long thought to have been written by Ambrose in
          the 4th century, but now regarded as a 5th-century account <br />by an
          unknown author (possibly Arnobius the Younger). This includes the "two
          martyrdoms", and the care by <br />Irene in between, and other details
          that remained part of the story.
        </p>
        <h2>Martyrdom</h2>
        <p>
          Sebastian had prudently concealed his faith, but in 286 it was detected.
          Diocletian reproached him for
          <br />his supposed betrayal, and he commanded him to be led to a field
          and there to be bound to a stake so that <br />the chosen archers from
          Mauretania would shoot arrows at him. "And the archers shot at him till
          he was as <br />full of arrows as an urchin is full of pricks, and thus
          left him there for dead." Miraculously, the arrows <br />did not kill
          him. The widow of Castulus, Irene of Rome, went to retrieve his body to
          bury it, and discovered <br />he was still alive. She brought him back
          to her house and nursed him back to health. Sebastian later stood
          <br />by a staircase where the emperor was to pass and harangued
          Diocletian for his cruelties against Christians. <br />This freedom of
          speech, and from a person whom he supposed to have been dead, greatly
          astonished the emperor; <br />but recovering from his surprise, he gave
          orders for Sebastian to be seized and beaten to death with cudgels,
          <br />and his body thrown into the common sewer. A pious lady, named
          Lucina, admonished by the martyr in a vision, <br />privately removed
          the body and buried it in the catacombs at the entrance of the cemetery
          of Calixtus, where <br />now stands the Basilica of St. Sebastian.
        </p>
        <h2>Location of remains</h2>
        <p>
          Remains reputed to be those of Sebastian are housed in Rome in the
          Basilica Apostolorum, built by Pope
          <br />Damasus I in 367 on the site of the provisional tomb of Saints
          Peter and Paul. The church, today called <br />San Sebastiano fuori le
          mura, was rebuilt in the 1610s under the patronage of Scipione Borghese.
          St. Ado, <br />Eginard, Sigebert, and other contemporary authors relate
          that, in the reign of Louis Debonnair, Pope Eugenius <br />II gave the
          body of St. Sebastian to Hilduin, Abbot of St. Denys, who brought it
          into France, and it was <br />deposited at Saint Medard Abbey, at
          Soissons, on 8 December, in 826. Sebastian's cranium was brought to the
          <br />town of Ebersberg (Germany) in 934. A Benedictine abbey was
          founded there and became one of the most important <br />pilgrimage
          sites in southern Germany. It is said the silver-encased cranium was
          used as a cup in which to <br />present the consecrated wine of the
          Blessed Sacrament to the faithful during the feast of Saint Sebastian.
        </p>
        <h2>As protector against plague</h2>
        <p>
          The belief that Saint Sebastian was a defense against the plague was a
          medieval addition to his reputation,
          <br />which largely accounts for the enormous increase in his importance
          in the Late Middle Ages. The connection <br />of the martyr shot with
          arrows with the plague is not an intuitive one, however. In Greco-Roman
          myth, Apollo, <br />the archer god, at times destroys his enemies by
          shooting plague-arrows from the heavens, but is also the <br />deliverer
          from pestilence; the figure of Sebastian Christianizes this folkloric
          association. The hopeful example <br />of Sebastian being able to
          recover from his "first martyrdom" (or "sagittation", as it is sometimes
          called) was <br />also relevant, and the arrow-wounds can resemble the
          buboes that were symptoms of bubonic plague. Visually, "the <br />arrow
          wounds call to God for mercy to us, as the symptoms of the unfirm call
          for pity from the passerby", as <br />Molanus put it.
        </p>
        <h2>Patronage</h2>
        <p>
          In the Roman Catholic Church, Sebastian is commemorated by an optional
          memorial on 20 January. In the
          <br />Church of Greece, Sebastian's feast day is on 18 December. As a
          protector from the bubonic plague, Sebastian <br />was formerly one of
          the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In Catholicism, Sebastian is the patron saint
          of archers, <br />pin-makers, athletes (a modern association) and of a
          holy death. Saint Sebastian by El Greco (1578) in Cathedral <br />of San
          Antolin, Palencia Sebastian is one of the patron saints of the city of
          Qormi in Malta Sebastian is the <br />patron saint of Acireale, Caserta
          and Petilia Policastro in Italy, Melilli in Sicily, and San Sebastian as
          well <br />as Palma de Mallorca, Lubrin and Huelva in Spain. He is the
          patron saint of Negombo, Sri Lanka and Rio de Janeiro, <br />Brazil.
          Informally, in the tradition of the Afro-Brazilian syncretic religion
          Umbanda, Sebastian is often associated <br />with Oxossi, especially in
          the state of Rio de Janeiro itself.
