          St. Philip Neri (22 July 1515-26 May 1595), known as the Second Apostle
          of Rome, after St. Peter, was
          <br />an Italian priest noted for founding a society of secular clergy
          called the Congregation of the Oratory. <br />Philip was the son of
          Francesco di Neri, a lawyer, and his wife Lucrezia da Mosciano, whose
          family were <br />nobility in the service of the state. He was brought
          up with great care and received his early teaching <br />from the friars
          at San Marco, the famous Dominican monastery in Florence. He was
          accustomed in later life <br />to ascribe most of his progress to the
          teaching of two of them - Zenobio de'Medici and Servanzio Mini. At
          <br />the age of 18, Philip was sent to his uncle, Romolo, a wealthy
          merchant at San Germano, a then Neapolitan <br />town near the base of
          Monte Cassino, to assist him in his business and with the hope that he
          might inherit <br />his uncle's fortune. He gained Romolo's confidence
          and affection, but soon after coming to San Germano, <br />Philip had a
          religious conversion.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission work</h2>
        <p>
          After arriving in Rome, Philip became a tutor in the house of a
          Florentine aristocrat named Galeotto Caccia.
          <br />After two years he began to pursue his own studies (for a period
          of three years) under the guidance of the <br />Augustinians. Following
          this, he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which, in later
          life, gained <br />him the title of "Apostle of Rome". He also
          ministered to the prostitutes of the city. In 1538 he entered into
          <br />the home mission work for which he became famous, traveling
          throughout the city, seeking opportunities of <br />entering into
          conversation with people, and of leading them to consider the topics he
          set before them. For <br />seventeen years Philip lived as a layman in
          Rome, probably without thinking of becoming a priest. Around 1544,
          <br />he made the acquaintance of Ignatius of Loyola. Many of Philip's
          disciples found their vocations in the infant <br />Society of Jesus.
        </p>
        <h2>Confraternity of the Holy Trinity</h2>
        <p>
          In 1548, together with his confessor, Persiano Rossa, Philip founded the
          Confraternity of the Most Holy
          <br />Trinity of Pilgrims and Convalescents (Italian:
          <em>Santissima Trinita de' Pellegrini e de' Convalescenti</em>),
          <br />whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands
          of poor pilgrims who flocked to Rome, <br />especially in jubilee years,
          and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were
          still <br />too weak for labour. Members met for prayer at the Church of
          San Salvatore in Campo where the devotion of <br />the Forty Hours of
          Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament was first introduced into Rome.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal character</h2>
        <p>
          Philip possessed a playful sense of humour, combined with a shrewd wit.
          He considered a cheerful temper
          <br />to be more Christian than a melancholy one, and carried this
          spirit into his whole life: "A joyful heart <br />is more easily made
          perfect than a downcast one." This was the secret of Neri's popularity
          and of his <br />place in the folklore of the Roman poor. Many miracles
          were attributed to him. When his body was examined <br />after death, it
          was found that two of his ribs had been broken, which was attributed at
          the time to the <br />expansion of his heart while fervently praying in
          the catacombs about the year 1545. Benedict XIV, who <br />reorganised
          the rules for canonization, decided that Philip's enlarged heart was
          caused by an aneurism. <br />Ponnelle and Bordet, in their 1932
          biography
          <em>St. Philip Neri and the Roman Society of His Times</em> (1515-1595),
          <br />conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural. What
          is certain is that Philip himself and his <br />penitents associated it
          with divine love.
        </p>
        <h2>Death and veneration</h2>
        <p>
          Philip Neri died around the end of the day on 25 May 1595, the Feast of
          Corpus Christi that year, after
          <br />having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors.
          About midnight he began hemorrhaging, <br />and Baronius read the
          commendatory prayers over him. Baronius asked that he bless his
          spiritual sons before <br />dying and, though he could no longer speak,
          he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died. Philip Neri
          <br />was beatified by Paul V in 1615 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV
          in 1622. His memorial is celebrated on 26 May. <br />His body is
          venerated in the Chiesa Nuova ("New Church") in Rome. Philip Neri is one
          of the influential figures <br />of the Counter-Reformation, and noted
          for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people
          within <br />the Church itself.
