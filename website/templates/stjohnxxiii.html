          Pope John XXIII (25 November 1881-3 June 1963) was Bishop of Rome and
          hence head of the Catholic Church
          <br />and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 28 October 1958 to
          his death in 1963. John was one of thirteen <br />children born to a
          family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was
          ordained to the <br />priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a
          number of posts, including as nuncio in France and delegate to
          <br />Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953,
          Pope Pius XII made John the Cardinal-Priest <br />of Santa Prisca, in
          addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice. He was unexpectedly
          elected Pope on <br />28 October 1958 at the age of 76 after 11 ballots.
          Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a <br />caretaker
          Pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the
          first session opening on 11 <br />October 1962.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Giuseppe Angelo Roncalli was born on 25 November 1881 in Sotto il Monte,
          a small country village in the
          <br />Bergamo province of the Lombardy region of Italy.[a] He was the
          eldest son of Giovanni Battista Roncalli <br />(1854-1935) and his wife
          Marianna Giulia Mazzola (1855-1939), and fourth in a family of 13. His
          family worked <br />as sharecroppers, as did most of the people of Sotto
          il Monte - a striking contrast to that of his predecessor, <br />Eugenio
          Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), who came from an ancient aristocratic family
          long connected to the papacy. <br />Roncalli was nonetheless a
          descendant of an Italian noble family, albeit from a secondary and
          impoverished <br />branch; "(he) derived from no mean origins but from
          worthy and respected folk who can be traced right back to <br />the
          beginning of the fifteenth century". The Roncallis maintained a vineyard
          and cornfields, and kept cattle. <br />In 1889, Roncalli received both
          his First Communion and Confirmation at the age of 8. On 1 March 1896,
          Luigi <br />Isacchi, the spiritual director of his seminary, enrolled
          him into the Secular Franciscan Order. He professed <br />his vows as a
          member of that order on 23 May 1897.
        </p>
        <h2>Priesthood</h2>
        <p>
          In 1905, Giacomo Radini-Tedeschi, the new Bishop of Bergamo, appointed
          Roncalli as his secretary. Roncalli
          <br />worked for Radini-Tedeschi until the bishop's death on 22 August
          1914, two days after the death of Pope Pius <br />X. Radini-Tedeschi's
          last words to Roncalli were "Angelo, pray for peace". The death of
          Radini-Tedeschi had <br />a deep effect on Roncalli. During this period
          Roncalli was also a lecturer in the diocesan seminary in Bergamo.
          <br />During World War I, Roncalli was drafted into the Royal Italian
          Army as a sergeant, serving in the medical corps <br />as a
          stretcher-bearer and as a chaplain. After being discharged from the army
          in early 1919, he was named spiritual <br />director of the seminary. On
          6 November 1921, Roncalli travelled to Rome where he was scheduled to
          meet the Pope. <br />After their meeting, Pope Benedict XV appointed him
          as the Italian president of the Society for the Propagation of <br />the
          Faith. Roncalli would recall Benedict XV as being the most sympathetic
          of the popes he had met.
        </p>
        <h2>Episcopate</h2>
        <p>
          In February 1925, the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri
          summoned him to the Vatican and informed
          <br />him of Pope Pius XI's decision to appoint him the Apostolic
          Visitor to Bulgaria (1925-1935). On 3 March, <br />Pius XI also
          appointed him titular archbishop of Areopolis, Jordan. Roncalli was
          initially reluctant about <br />a mission to Bulgaria, but he soon
          relented. His nomination as apostolic visitor was made official on 19
          <br />March. Roncalli was consecrated a bishop by Giovanni Tacci
          Porcelli in the church of San Carlo al Corso in <br />Rome. On 30
          November 1934, he was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Turkey and Greece
          and titular archbishop <br />of Mesembria, Bulgaria. He became known in
          Turkey's predominantly Muslim society as "the Turcophile Pope".
          <br />Roncalli took up this post in 1935 and used his office to help the
          Jewish underground in saving thousands of <br />refugees in Europe,
          leading some to consider him to be a Righteous Gentile (see Pope John
          XXIII and Judaism). <br />In October 1935, he led Bulgarian pilgrims to
          Rome and introduced them to Pope Pius XI on 14 October.
        </p>
        <h2>Papal Election</h2>
        <p>
          Following the death of Pope Pius XII on 9 October 1958, Roncalli watched
          the live funeral on his last full
          <br />day in Venice on 11 October. His journal was specifically
          concerned with the funeral and the abused state <br />of the late
          pontiff's corpse. Roncalli left Venice for the conclave in Rome well
          aware that he was papabile, <br />and after eleven ballots, was elected
          to succeed the late Pius XII, so it came as no surprise to him, though
          <br />he had arrived at the Vatican with a return train ticket to
          Venice. Many had considered Giovanni Battista <br />Montini, the
          Archbishop of Milan, a possible candidate, but, although he was the
          archbishop of one of the <br />most ancient and prominent sees in Italy,
          he had not yet been made a cardinal. Though his absence from the
          <br />1958 conclave did not make him ineligible - under Canon Law any
          Catholic male who is capable of receiving <br />priestly ordination and
          episcopal consecration may be elected - the College of Cardinals usually
          chose the <br />new pontiff from among the Cardinals who attend the
          papal conclave. At the time, as opposed to modern <br />practice, the
          participating Cardinals did not have to be below age 80 to vote, there
          were few Eastern-rite <br />Cardinals, and some Cardinals were just
          priests at the time of their elevation. Roncalli was summoned to the
          <br />final ballot of the conclave at 4:00 pm. He was elected pope at
          4:30 pm with a total of 38 votes.
        </p>
        <h2>Final months and death</h2>
        <p>
          On 23 September 1962, Pope John XXIII was diagnosed with stomach cancer.
          The diagnosis, which was kept
          <br />from the public, followed nearly eight months of occasional
          stomach hemorrhages, and reduced the pontiff's <br />appearances.
          Looking pale and drawn during these events, he gave a hint to his
          ultimate fate in April 1963, <br />when he said to visitors, "That which
          happens to all men perhaps will happen soon to the Pope who speaks
          <br />to you today." On 25 May 1963, the pope suffered another
          haemorrhage and required several blood transfusions, <br />but the
          cancer had perforated the stomach wall and peritonitis soon set in. The
          doctors conferred in a decision <br />regarding this matter and John
          XXIII's aide Loris F. Capovilla broke the news to him saying that the
          cancer had <br />done its work and nothing could be done for him. Around
          this time, his remaining siblings arrived to be with <br />him. By 31
          May, it had become clear that the cancer had overcome the resistance of
          John XXIII - it had left him <br />confined to his bed. John XXIII died
          of peritonitis caused by a perforated stomach at 19:49 local time on 3
          June <br />1963 at the age of 81, ending a historic pontificate of four
          years and seven months. He died just as a Mass for <br />him finished in
          Saint Peter's Square below, celebrated by Luigi Traglia. After he died,
          his brow was ritually <br />tapped to see if he was dead, and those with
          him in the room said prayers.
